As conventional carmakers trade at rock-bottom prices amid a broad industry malaise brought on by China’s economic slowdown and growing fears of Trump tariffs, Tesla’s stock continues to soar, creating one of the biggest valuation gaps it’s ever seen.\n\n>On Friday, Tesla reclaimed its place in the elite club of companies worth more than $1 trillion after adding a full third in market capitalization since Election Day less than a week ago. The last time Tesla was worth this amount of money it was April 2022, Musk had just revealed his $44 billion plan to acquire Twitter.\n\n>Relative to its peers, Tesla is now worth more than the next 15 largest carmakers combined—from Toyota and General Motors all the way down to Jeep’s parent company Stellantis and Hyundai. Toss in lower ranked names like Kia and Renault, respectively worth $26.6 billion and $12.6 billion, and Tesla is still is still ahead, only drawing even once the $8.8 billion from Japan’s Nissan is thrown into the mix."

Behind his nearly $20 billion jump in wealth was a deal that shot up Musk’s rocket company SpaceX’s valuation to roughly $350 billion, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. SpaceX and its investors agreed to purchase as much as $1.25 billion of insider shares. Tesla shares closed at a record high on Wednesday, hitting $424.77 at market close. Musk, who is Tesla’s largest individual shareholder, has also enjoyed the stock propelling higher in part due to the broader market — NASDAQ topped 20,000 for the first time ever Wednesday. Since Election Day, the EV maker’s stock has rallied roughly 65% on investors’ belief that Musk’s influence in the Trump administration will usher in an era of deregulation that will benefit the company.\n\n> His artificial intelligence startup, xAI, also more than doubled in value in November amid a new funding round, surging to $50 billion from a few months ago, according to the Wall Street Journal. The world’s wealthiest man is now roughly $136 billion richer since November 5, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. While the top spots on the billionaires index typically switch around, Musk is racing past his wealthy peers. As of December 10, before his wealth skyrocketed to $400 billion, he was already $140 billion richer than the second-richest man on Earth, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.\n\n> Musk’s record-breaking Tesla-shareholder-approved pay package, which was worth $101 billion, was rejected by a Delaware court last week. Bloomberg’s calculation still seems to include the pay package, which is now worth as much as $120 billion based on the current value of Tesla shares."

Do you realize how much money that is in actual dollars?\n\nYes, I get it—crypto and Nvidia have spoiled you with their ridiculous, lottery-like returns of 10,000% in a few years. But acting like a 20% gain is somehow “worthless” or not enough shows how distorted the expectations here have become.\n\nIf you had invested $10,000 in Microsoft 10 years ago, you’d be sitting on over $90,000 today—and that’s not even considering dividends or reinvestments. If you had added just $150 monthly to your position over the past 10 years, your portfolio would be worth hundreds of thousands now. That’s the power of consistent investing in real, reliable growth companies.\n\nMicrosoft is a rock-solid investment. Not every stock needs to pump 10,000% to be worth holding.

        "selftext": "Nvidia lost close to $600 billion in market cap on Monday, the biggest drop for any company on a single day in U.S. history.\n\nThe chipmaker’s stock price plummeted 17% to close at $118.58. It was Nvidia’s worst day on the market since March 16, 2020, which was early in the Covid pandemic. After surpassing Apple last week to become the most valuable publicly traded company, Nvidia’s drop on Monday led a 3.1% slide in the tech-heavy Nasdaq.\n\nThe selloff was sparked by concerns that Chinese artificial intelligence lab DeepSeek is presenting increased competition in the global AI battle. Late last month, DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it says took only two months and less than $6 million to build, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia, called H800s. \n\nNvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the market for AI data center chips in the U.S., with tech giants like Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon spending billions of dollars on the processors to train and run their AI models. Analysts at Cantor wrote in a report on Monday that the release of DeepSeek’s latest technology has caused “great angst as to the impact for compute demand, and therefore, fears of peak spending on GPUs.”\n\nThe analysts, who recommend buying Nvidia shares, said they “think this view is farthest from the truth,” and that advancements in AI will most likely lead to “the AI industry wanting more compute, not less.”\n\nBut after Nvidia’s huge run-up — the stock soared 239% in 2023 and 171% last year — the market is on edge about any possible pullback in spending. Broadcom, the other big U.S. chipmaker to see giant valuation gains from AI, fell 17% on Monday, pulling its market cap down by $200 billion.\n\nData center companies reliant on Nvidia’s GPUs for their hardware sales saw big selloffs as well. Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Super Micro Computer dropped at least 5.8%. Oracle, a part of President Donald Trump’s latest AI initiative, fell 14%.\n\nFor Nvidia, the loss was more than double the $279 billion drop the company saw in September, which was the biggest one-day market value loss in history at the time, unseating Meta’s $232 billion loss in 2022. Before that, the steepest drop was $182 billion by Apple in 2020.\n\nNvidia’s decline is more than double the market cap of Coca-Cola and Chevron and exceeds the market value of both Oracle and Netflix.\n\nCEO Jensen Huang’s net worth also took a massive hit, declining roughly $21 billion, according to Forbes’ real-time billionaires list. The move demoted Huang to 17th on the richest-person list.\n\nThe sudden excitement around DeepSeek over the weekend pushed its app past OpenAI’s ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple’s App Store. The model’s development comes despite a slew of recent curbs on U.S. chip exports to China.\n\nVenture capitalist David Sacks, who was tapped by Trump to be the White House’s AI and crypto czar, wrote on X that DeepSeek’s model “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and that Trump was right to rescind President Joe Biden’s executive order last week on AI safety.\n\n“I’m confident in the U.S. but we can’t be complacent,” Sacks wrote.\n\nNvidia is now the third most-valuable public company, behind Apple and Microsoft.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/27/nvidia-sheds-almost-600-billion-in-market-cap-biggest-drop-ever.html"

The fund, which manages assets of around USD 1.8 trillion and holds a significant stake in Tesla, voted against Musk’s compensation proposal, prompting him to admonish CEO Nicolai Tangen not to request any “favors” until making amends.\n\nIn their exchange, Musk also accused Tangen of leaking the texts to the media, after Norwegian outlets reported on his canceled dinner appearance at the Oil Fund’s investment conference. Tangen countered that Norway’s strict transparency laws, akin to the U.S. Freedom of Information Act, required partial disclosure, including confirmation that Musk would not attend.\n\nInitially, the Oil Fund classified much of the conversation as private and withheld it. However, in the spirit of transparency, they eventually released all texts. The incident highlights the tension between Musk’s calls for discretion and the Norwegian Oil Fund’s legal obligations to remain open. While emphasizing a positive relationship with Tesla as a critical investment, the fund has reiterated its opposition to Musk’s pay plan."

He didn’t specify the levy, though he’s previously said it would be 10%. Trump has said Beijing failed to follow through on promises to prevent fentanyl and the chemicals used to make the deadly drugs from flowing into the US.\n\n>“With China, I’m also thinking about something because they’re sending fentanyl into our country, and because of that, they’re causing us hundreds of thousands of deaths,” Trump said Thursday. “So China is going to end up paying a tariff also for that, and we’re in the process of doing that.”\n\n>Trump has ordered his administration to investigate whether China complied with a trade deal struck during his first term, setting the stage for tariffs against the world’s second largest economy.\n\n>Following through on tariffs against Canada and Mexico, who are US neighbors, major trading partners, and export markets, threatens to have dramatic economic consequences, rattle markets and potentially launch a trade war by undermining protections from a three-nation free trade agreement.\n\n>Both countries have pledged to respond to any trade levies, including with retaliatory tariffs, even as their leaders sought to assure the US they were addressing border concerns in a bid to defuse the conflict.\n\n>“If these tariffs go into effect, Canada will respond,” Canadian Ambassador to the US Kirsten Hillman said Thursday. “This is not something that we want to do. We do not want to get into a tariff-back-and-forth with the United States. It’s not good for Canada, Canadians and Canadian workers and it’s not good for the United States, Americans and American workers.”\n\n>Hillman said that Canada has responded to Trump’s concerns about the border by clamping down and announcing new security measures, including added drones and helicopters.\n\n>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort even before the president was inaugurated in a bid to ease tensions between their nations, and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum spoke to Trump to try to avert the levies.\n\n>In the first 11 months of 2024, US trade with Canada totaled $699 billion and $776 billion with Mexico. And the magnitude of tariffs Trump will enact could have stark impacts on particular industries, such as the auto industry and the energy sector. Shares of US automakers Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. turned negative on the announcement, erasing earlier gains.\n\n>“President Trump’s tariffs will tax America first,” Matthew Holmes, executive vice president at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said Thursday. “From higher costs at the pumps, grocery stores and online checkout, tariffs cascade through the economy and end up hurting consumers and businesses on both sides of the border. This is a lose-lose.”\n\n>Trump is also promising sectoral tariffs, such as on pharmaceuticals, semiconductor chips, steel, aluminum and copper, which could apply widely to many countries, including Canada and Mexico.\n\n>The US president is an avowed believer in tariffs, saying they will force a renaissance in domestic manufacturing, though industry groups warn that it will upend supply chains and endanger existing factories by raising costs of source materials.\n\n>He’s hailed tariffs as a source of revenue as lawmakers move to renew and expand expiring tax cuts and approve other credits and benefits the president promised on the campaign trail. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate to 15% for firms that manufacture goods in the US, compared to the current 21% rate.said he would follow through on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1, citing the flow of fentanyl and large trade deficits as among the reasons for his decision.\n\n>“We’ll be announcing the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a number of reasons,” Trump told reporters Thursday in the Oval Office as he signed executive actions in response to a deadly airplane collision.\n\n>“Number one is the people that have poured into our country so horribly and so much. Number two are the drugs, fentanyl and everything else that have come into the country. Number three are the massive subsidies that we’re giving to Canada and to Mexico in the form of deficits,” he said.\n\n>West Texas Intermediate oil futures climbed above $73 a barrel following the comments. The US dollar wiped out an earlier loss to touch the day’s high after the remarks, while the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso both plunged. US Treasuries pared their gains.\n\nLink: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-30/trump-says-he-ll-hit-canada-mexico-with-25-tariffs-on-saturday](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-30/trump-says-he-ll-hit-canada-mexico-with-25-tariffs-on-saturday)"

They are new and unproven and they don't have anything resembling a profit or net income.  Why do you want to buy this thing?\n\nClient: My son-in-law recommended it.

How many shares are you considering?\n\nClient: I want to buy 1,000 shares!\n\nMe: That's $80,000! (A lot of money now, but really a lot back in the late 1990s).\n\nClient: I know.

Buy me 50 shares of eToys!\n\nI bought the shares, the company went bankrupt, and she lost all of her money.

According to a new report from CNBC, Tesla’s sales in China dropped 11.5% this January compared to the same time last year. With China setting the pace for the global EV industry, Tesla is rapidly losing ground to local giants like BYD.\n\nIt’s not just a sales dip, it’s a wipeout. In January, BYD sold 30% more EVs than Tesla worldwide. The reason? Cost and variety.\n\nWhile Tesla leans on price cuts to compete, Chinese brands like BYD are already priced lower from the start. Tesla’s profit margins, once its strong suit, are shrinking fast, while BYD keeps scaling production without sacrificing profitability. The Model 3 and Model Y Tesla’s core models are struggling to hold their own against a flood of cheaper, high-tech, government-backed alternatives.\n\nFor years, Tesla thrived under China’s policies that welcomed foreign EV makers. That era is over. The Chinese government has made it clear, they want their own brands to lead the global EV race. Companies like BYD, Nio, and XPeng are now the priority, while Tesla is increasingly seen as an outsider.\n\nTesla’s Shanghai Gigafactory, once a strategic advantage, is now a vulnerability. The Chinese government could tighten regulations, cut subsidies, or tilt the playing field even further in favor of domestic competitors, any of which would weaken Tesla’s foothold even more.\n\nElon’s strategy of constant price cuts has helped sustain demand, but the latest 11.5% sales drop suggests the approach is losing its effectiveness. Cutting prices again and again doesn’t build brand loyalty.. It signals that demand is slipping.\n\nAnd Tesla can’t keep squeezing its margins forever. The competition isn’t slowing down it’s accelerating."

But honestly, I see some major red flags:\n\n\n\n📉 Shrinking Profit Margins – Tesla’s margins have been steadily declining for years. Not a great trend.\n\n\n\n🏴‍☠️ Musk’s PR Nightmare – Elon literally gave a “Sieg Heil” on live TV. Now, a huge chunk of the world sees him (and by extension, Tesla) as a Nazi. That’s… not exactly great for brand reputation.\n\n\n\n🚗 Cybertruck is a Mess – Poor build quality, tons of issues, and at this point, it’s basically a meme.\n\n\n\n🌍 New Political & Tariff Risks – Tesla is vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, an anti-EV U.S. President, and a California governor who hates Musk and might pull state EV rebates.\n\n\n\n⚡ Serious Competition is Catching Up – Tesla isn’t the undisputed EV/FSD leader anymore. Other companies are matching—or surpassing—them in innovation.\n\n\n\n🚦 FSD is Overhyped – Despite all the robotaxi talk, Tesla’s self-driving tech is still only Level 2-3. Meanwhile, other companies already have Level 4 robotaxis on the road.\n\n\n\n🔋 Rising Costs = Profit Squeeze – Raw material costs are going up, and Trump’s tariffs on China-made batteries could make things even worse.\n\n\n\n🤖 Tesla is Struggling to Attract Top AI Talent – Even before Musk’s latest antics, nearly all top AI researchers and recent ML PhD graduates from the top schools were choosing OpenAI, Anthropic, or GAMMA (Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Apple) over Tesla or xAI. Now? Even fewer want to work there, which could hurt Tesla’s AI progress.\n\n\n\n🔵 Losing Left-Leaning Consumers – Left-leaning buyers are way more likely to buy EVs than right-leaning ones. And almost every left-leaning consumer has grown to despise Musk, leading them to choose non-Tesla EVs instead.\n\n\n\nTesla used to be the Nvidia of EVs—they were miles ahead of everyone else. But that’s just not the case anymore. There are more non-Tesla EV options every year, and in terms of FSD, several companies already have a better product and better talent. So, to me, a $1.1 trillion valuation feels ridiculous.\n\n\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I being too bearish, or is Tesla in for some rough times ahead?"

The selling included Apple, which remained its largest stock investment.\n\n\"Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities,\" Buffett wrote.\n\n'FISCAL FOLLY'\n\nThis year is Buffett's 60th at the helm of Berkshire, which he transformed from a failing textile company into a $1.03 trillion conglomerate with dozens of businesses in insurance, railroad, energy, industrial, retail and other sectors.\n\n\"Berkshire's activities now impact all corners of our country. And we are not finished,\" Buffett said.\n\nBuffett said Berkshire will continue preferring equities, primarily U.S. stocks, over cash, even as it resists paying a dividend to shareholders, which it has not done since 1967.\n\nHe said reinvesting in Berkshire is one reason the Omaha, Nebraska-based company paid $26.8 billion of federal taxes last year, 5% of all payments by corporate America. Buffett himself is worth $149.5 billion, Forbes magazine said,\nBut he also sent a cautionary message to Washington, lamenting how capitalism \"has its faults and abuses--in certain respects more egregious now than ever,\" with malfeasance by \"scoundrels and promoters\" in full force.\n\nHe urged lawmakers to help preserve a stable U.S. dollar, saying \"fiscal folly\" can destroy the value of paper money and the country has at times \"come close to the edge.\"\n\nBuffett said long-term success of Berkshire and the American economy, which he called the \"American miracle,\" has depended on people's ability to participate.\n\nThat, he said, is something Uncle Sam can encourage, or take away.\n\n\"Take care of the many who, for no fault of their own, get the short straws in life. They deserve better,\" Buffett wrote, addressing the government.\n\"And never forget that we need you to maintain a stable currency and that result requires both wisdom and vigilance on your part,\" he added.\n\nCathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research who rates Berkshire \"hold,\" said: \"Talking about the business of America being messy was his way of addressing the political landscape and its impact on the macroeconomic environment. He is warning Washington: Be careful where you tread.\"\n\nFEWER BUYING OPPORTUNITIES\n\nWhile Berkshire has not made a major purchase of an entire company since 2016, Buffett said it is likely to increase its combined $23.5 billion of investments in five Japanese trading houses: Itochu (8001.T), opens new tab, Marubeni (8002.T), opens new tab, Mitsubishi (8058.T), opens new tab, Mitsui (8031.T), opens new tab and Sumitomo (8053.T), opens new tab.\n\nOther stocks appear pricey, with the Standard & Poor's 500 (.SPX), opens new tab hitting a new high on Wednesday and the Nasdaq (.IXIC), opens new tab just 3% below its December 16 peak.\n\nBerkshire's size also inhibits its shares from trouncing the indexes, as they did decades ago.\nThe company's stock price has risen 15% in the last year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 rose 18%.\n\nOver the last decade, Berkshire's stock price has risen 225%, while the index rose 241% including dividends and 185% excluding dividends, Reuters data show.\n\n\"They will have lots of buying opportunities but Berkshire will never be the large double-digit compounder it had been,\" said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management in Phoenix.\n\nAt Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett will spend less time on the stage in a downtown Omaha arena where he, Abel and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain will answer shareholder questions.\n\nTens of thousands of people attend the meeting and a weekend of shareholder events, including shopping.\n\nBuffett told Fortune magazine last month that he was still having fun and able to do a few things reasonably well, while other activities had been \"eliminated or greatly minimized.\"\n\nThe meeting will also not feature the traditional movie created by Buffett's daughter Susie.\nIn discussing his age, Buffett said he talks regularly on Sundays with his 91-year-old sister Bertie, using an old-fashioned phone.\n\n\"We cover the joys of old age and discuss such exciting topics as the relative merits of our canes,\" he said. \"In my case, the utility is limited to the avoidance of falling flat on my face.\"\n\n"

        "selftext": "Tesla’s postelection pop has almost disappeared.\n\nShares of the electric vehicle maker plunged more than 8% on Tuesday, pushing the company’s market cap below $1 trillion and to its lowest since Nov. 7, which was two days after President Donald Trump’s election victory.\n\nThe stock has plummeted 25% to start the year, while the Nasdaq is down just 1.5%, and has slid more than 35% from its record close on Dec. 16. CEO Elon Musk has lost more than $100 billion in net worth over that stretch, though he is still the world’s richest person, with a fortune valued at about $380 billion.\n\nThe latest slide followed a report from Reuters on Monday that Tesla’s long-awaited upgrade to its partially automated driving systems left owners disappointed. Many users told the publication that Tesla’s “navigate on city streets” feature in China fell short of Musk’s promises for self-driving technology.\n\nOther EV makers in China, including BYD, offer their partially automated driving systems for free or a much lower cost. Xiaomi’s popular model SU7 includes the company’s equivalent technology as a standard option for free.\n\nThe report out of China added to anxiety among Tesla shareholders. Some of the concern has to do with the company’s performance and some is specific to Musk, who is spending much of his time in Washington, D.C., leading President Trump’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.\n\nMusk, along with his team in Washington, has gained unparalleled access to government computer systems and taxpayer data, and the president has enabled the billionaire to lead mass firings of workers in agencies tasked with oversight of his companies, including Tesla.\n\nMusk’s extremist political rhetoric and activism has led opponents in various markets to organize protests, including at Tesla stores and service centers. Tesla’s stock dropped earlier this month on Trump’s announced plans for extensive tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico and China, which came alongside a decline in Tesla vehicle registrations across Europe in January and February.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Tesla reported earnings and sales that missed analysts’ estimates, with automotive revenue dropping 8% from a year earlier and operating income plummeting 23%. In the late January report, the company cited reduced average selling prices across its aging lineup of Model 3, Model Y, Model S and Model X vehicles as a major reason for the decline.\n\nAccording to the California New Car Dealers Association, Tesla sales dropped 11.6% in the fourth quarter of 2024 in the state, which had been Tesla’s biggest market domestically.\n\nTesla shares are now about 20% above where they were trading prior to Trump’s victory. Most of what remains of the rally is due to the stock’s 15% jump the day after the election. Musk was a major backer of Trump’s presidential effort, contributing $290 million to Republican candidates and causes in 2024, with most of that directed at returning Trump to the White House.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/25/teslas-market-cap-sinks-below-1-trillion-as-stock-falls-more-than-9percent.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/25/teslas-market-cap-sinks-below-1-trillion-as-stock-falls-more-than-9percent.html)"

I watched VXX, (VIX ETF),  BABA, FXI, SPY, plus other trade war participants that would be most affected. Interested mainly in triple levered ETFs like UPRO or YINN at the open to see if there's more volatility coming in (which there likely will be). This is somewhat of an incremental headline because we've seen Trump announce tariffs before but we never knew if they were a bluff or not, but today's tweet might be confirmation that this is actually happening (unless yet again, this is a bluff).\n\nThe trade for most of these catalysts is mainly just waiting with your hands on the keyboard and waiting for most of these tweets and being quick on the draw. I traded when Trump was president back in 2016-2020 and read close to every tweet he made.\n\n**I'm most interested in BABA on the news because we're already so over extended from the Chinese government's announcement of liquidity measures yesterday (it was what resulted in the 4% spike yesterday).**"

        "selftext": ">Microsoft Corp. is signaling the end of the line for Skype, the iconic internet calling and chat service it bought almost 14 years ago.\n\n>Once a byword for digital calls that bypassed long-distance charges, Skype was surpassed in recent years by smartphone-native communication apps and Zoom video calls. When Microsoft tried to stretch the Skype brand into the workplace, it lost out to Slack Technologies Inc.\n\n>Microsoft’s response was to start from scratch and build Teams, a chat, voice and video communication service for the workplace, which gained ground as part of its software bundle. The Redmond, Washington-based company will offer Skype users the option of migrating to Teams, which is now its strongest rival to Salesforce Inc.-owned Slack, before it shuts down in May.\n\n>“I’ve been at Microsoft for over 30 years, and there’s a lot of software that we’ve done that was incredibly valuable in its era, and then the next era came and it was the foundation,” said Jeff Teper, a Microsoft president who oversees communications and collaboration tools.\n\n>Microsoft said there were more than 300 million monthly Skype users in 2016, but its daily user count had dwindled to 36 million in 2023. Teams, by comparison, has risen to 320 million monthly users.\n\n>Founded in 2003 by Nordic entrepreneurs, Skype at one time was owned by eBay Inc. and was in the hands of a private equity-led consortium when Steve Ballmer came knocking. The then-Microsoft boss made an uncharacteristically splashy bet on the market leader in online calls, paying $8.5 billion, a 40% premium to Skype’s internal valuation. The May 2011 deal was the largest acquisition by Microsoft at the time, and Skype became a key piece of its strategy for the emerging mobile age.\n\n>It didn’t pan out as Ballmer would have hoped. Upstarts like Telegram, Snapchat, WeChat and WhatsApp solved problems that Skype didn’t. Microsoft’s center of gravity in corporate software ultimately ensnared Skype, which found itself in the Office division and under orders to build tools geared toward a workplace audience as well as a consumer one.\n\n>By the time Slack arrived on the scene, Skype users were complaining that elements of the core experience had started to break down. They cited missed or phantom calls and failures to sync information on different devices. The company worked to improve the service’s reliability, but some loyal users were put off by frequent redesigns, including a short-lived effort to fashion Skype in the mold of Snapchat.\n\n>Microsoft, which also saw its acquisition of Nokia Oyj’s mobile phone business end in failure, is far from alone in encountering rejection by a fickle consumer market. Alphabet Inc.’s Google has cycled through several iterations and brands for its online communications tools, which are today known as Chat and Meet. And this month, Amazon.com Inc. said it would be winding down Chime, the video and voice calling service it tried with little success to sell to corporate clients.\n\n>The Windows maker is shuttering Skype to focus on developing new features for Teams, including artificial intelligence tools, Teper said. The company is working to infuse AI into its product suite, while keeping a lid on spending that isn’t part of that effort. It’s reassigning staff that had worked on Skype to other areas of the business and will not lay anyone off, Teper added.\n\n>At one point, Skype played host to one of Microsoft’s biggest AI demonstrations: a real-time translator. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella had nudged researchers to bring the product to market as quickly as possible and heralded it as “magical” in a 2014 demonstration early on in his tenure.\n\n>Teams is “going well and this is a step to double down on it,” Teper said, adding that Microsoft wanted to keep Skype running until it was confident that the Teams version for individual users was fully ready. “It’s the most successful product in its category by far,” he said.\n\n\n\nLink: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-28/microsoft-msft-to-shut-down-skype-as-zoom-teams-dominate-video-calls](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-28/microsoft-msft-to-shut-down-skype-as-zoom-teams-dominate-video-calls)\n\n**My Take:** Thank god. ZM might stand to be a major benefactor from this. MSFT already has Teams that serves as a workplace call tool, but Skype has tried to expand into the workplace forum space (like Slack) and has failed. MSFT is citing this more as a doubling-down on Teams rather than admitting ZM has eaten their lunch here."

Norway can be a reference for other markets in the future but only if Tesla is able to clean up their reputation.\n\nSince administration only started on the 21st, we will only see the real effect of decline in sales when numbers from March are published. Some other countries share car registrations which are from a time point a view much more reliable than sales, since it's unclear if this is about cars being delivered or ordered.\n\n**Reasons of decline**\n\n* (stronger) competition\n* oversaturation of Tesla, people want to have another car as the rest\n* customers possibly waiting for new Tesla Y \n* Musk\n\nAlthough oversaturation is less of a risk in other countries, people still steer away from Tesla in favour of different, fresher designs. Tesla is focusing a lot on new tech gadgets/software, while their cars still almost look the same as many years ago.\n\n**Conclusion and near future**\n\nAlthough it's unclear if the numbers are deliveries or orders in February, we might see a further decline. People that  already decided to buy a Tesla are unlikely to cancel their order. In Norway we might see almost no sales anymore because until new Tesla Y rolls out. In other countries sales could plunge the same as in Norway.\n\nIf the decline of sales becomes a trend this will in the short term become a big logistic and manufactoring problem for Tesla. They'll have to start dealing with overstock, production might need to be halted since more production might just lead to more overstock."

        "selftext": ">President Donald Trump called for ending a bipartisan $52 billion semiconductor subsidy program that’s spurred more than $400 billion in investments from companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Intel Corp.\n\n>“Your Chips Act is a horrible, horrible thing,” the president said in a prime-time address to Congress on Tuesday. Trump implored US House Speaker Mike Johnson to get rid of the legislation and use “whatever is left over” to “reduce debt or any other reason.”\n\n>His remarks were met with applause in a chamber that passed the Chips and Science Act less than three years ago. Vice President JD Vance, whose home state of Ohio won a massive Intel project thanks to the law, stood up to show his support for its revocation.\n\n>The Chips Act is among the most significant US forays into industrial policy in more than a generation. It set aside $39 billion in grants — plus loans and 25% tax breaks — to revitalize American semiconductor manufacturing, as well as $11 billion for chip research and development. The aim was to reduce reliance on Asia for electronic components that power everything from smartphones to massive data centers.\n\n>Trump, however, has consistently derided a program he regards as a waste of government funds, arguing tariffs would achieve the same outcome while filling coffers. Republicans have also indicated that they want to repeal what they see as “social” provisions of the Chips Act. That could involve eliminating labor-friendly regulations or environmental requirements.\n\n>Officials on both sides of the aisle have touted the Chips Act as crucial to US national and economic security, and Trump could have a hard time getting congressional support to repeal it. Dozens of GOP lawmakers voted for the measure, and many red districts have won factories or other projects supported by the law.\n\n>That includes South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. and SK Hynix Inc., which have committed to multibillion-dollar projects in Texas and Indiana that were contingent on funding and support from the US government. Company representatives declined to comment on the president’s remarks.\n\n>Trump, favoring tariffs over incentives, has signaled that import levies on chips could come as soon as next month. Companies can avoid those duties, he has said, by building factories on American soil. He has not offered additional details.\n\n>On Monday, Trump credited the tariff threats for TSMC’s decision to invest $100 billion in the US, on top of a previous $65 billion commitment. He touted that project in his address Tuesday, referencing the full $165 billion figure. “We’re giving them no money,” Trump said. “All that was important to them was they didn’t want to pay the tariffs.”\n\n>A TSMC spokesperson declined to comment.\n\n>The company originally announced plans for a $12 billion US site during Trump’s first term and expanded that project to three factories under Biden. To support those facilities, TSMC struck an agreement with Biden officials for $6.6 billion in Chips Act grants and $5 billion in loans.\n\n>As is the case for other Chips Act awards, the funding is supposed to be disbursed over time, as TSMC hits negotiated project milestones. The company received $1.5 billion before Biden left office.\n\n>Trump did not specify whether he would attempt to claw back money that’s already been disbursed, renege on remaining incentives to which the government has already committed, or simply not provide additional support for the chipmaker’s latest investment. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Monday that the newly announced projects — three additional chip plants, plus R&D and advanced packaging sites — won’t win federal funds.\n\n>“The main uncertainty is the future of TSMC,” said Xin-Yao Ng, an investment director at abrdn plc. “One long-time competitive advantage was their clustering in Taiwan, where labor costs are still reasonable, construction costs are cheaper, government is supportive, and they can find more workers with vocational training. It’s completely different in the US if they are to shift more manufacturing. Subsidies from US were to be crucial to help mitigate some of the higher costs and challenges.”\n\n>TSMC is among 20 companies that reached binding Chips Act agreements with Biden officials. The deals, which represent more than 85% of the manufacturing incentives available under the program, are designed to support leading-edge facilities by companies like TSMC, Intel, Samsung and Micron Technology Inc. — as well as older-generation factories by the likes of GlobalFoundries Inc. and Texas Instruments Inc.\n\n>Companies have generally viewed those agreements as ironclad — regardless of who’s in office. But some of them have worried that the Trump administration could seek to modify the terms, Bloomberg has reported. Lutnick has said he cannot commit to honoring existing contracts without reviewing them first.\n\n>That review is ongoing, and Lutnick’s intentions for the initiative remain unclear. So far, his questions to program staff have focused on the rationale behind award decisions and the government’s legal authority to claw money back, Bloomberg has reported. The current Chips Act team, meanwhile, has been preparing a list of potential adjustments to the funding application process and final contracts that would be minimally disruptive.\n\n>A spokesperson for GlobalWafers Co., which won $406 million from the Chips Act for factories in Texas and Missouri, said the Taiwanese company is committed to its expansion strategy and views any changes to the Chips Act as “unlikely.”\n\n>But if the law were to be modified in some way, the spokesperson said, “we would reassess future investments, including evaluating US market demand, pricing, and potential tariffs if production were moved outside the US.”\n\n**My take:** Brutally bad for semiconductor sector if CHIPS is actually repealed, INTC is especially targeted. There'd be less semiconductor manufacturing in the US (INTC/TSM/Samsung) primarily because we subsidize and have tax incentives for current US chip manfacturing projects, and companies that haven't received their funding will likely scale back projects [(remember INTC delayed their Ohio plant to 2028?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1j0cq51/intel_delays_28_billion_ohio_chip_factory_in_new/). The US would also be far more dependent on semiconductor production overseas. \n\nThis also has spillover into the quantum computing stocks (IONQ/RGTI) and AI sector due to the sectors being so reliant on technological development and supply from the semis sectors.\n\nOverall don't think new tariffs are going to be an adequate replacement for what the US has committed so far (but we don't know much about  the tariffs yet), and the markets hate uncertainty.\n\nLink: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-05/trump-calls-for-end-to-52-billion-chips-act-subsidy-program](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-05/trump-calls-for-end-to-52-billion-chips-act-subsidy-program)"

Yes I posted this Sunday and TSLA is currently down 13% today.

The majority of respondents also expect Tesla deliveries to fall this year, according to the survey.\n\nWhile a small sampling, these results offer the latest sign of mounting frustration with the billionaire entrepreneur as he’s become a rising figure in international and American politics. It also comes at a pivotal point for Tesla’s stock, with shares plunging nearly 40% this year.\n\nWhen asked about Musk’s efforts with U.S. government efficiency and other political activities, 45% of respondents said these actions had a “negative” effect on the company. Another 40% said they were having an “extremely negative” impact.\n\nOn the other hand, 3% said they were “positive” for the business. Meanwhile, 12% called them “insignificant.”\n\nTo be sure, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas reported that his survey respondents are drawn from his email distribution list and should not be taken as a random representative sample. He also noted that the respondents are not necessarily owners of Tesla stock. The survey was taken over a 17-hour period, starting on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nJonas also asked about expectations for the company’s performance. In a separate question, 59% said they anticipated Tesla would deliver fewer cars to customers in 2025 compared with the prior year. What’s more, 21% of total respondents said they expected a decline of more than 10%. That comes as some analysts have raised alarm that recent reports of vandalism could spook potential customers.\n\nJust 19% of responders said they forecasted deliveries to rise in 2025, while another 23% said they would be flat between the two years.\n\nMusk’s political profile has grown after his public support of President Donald Trump in the runup up to last year’s election and his subsequent role leading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The Tesla executive’s efforts to slash the federal government’s spending and workforce has drawn the ire of critics who see his team as working too quickly and haphazardly.\n\nMusk acknowledged in an interview with Fox Business on Monday that his high-profile role in Trump’s administration meant he was running his businesses, which also include X and SpaceX, “with great difficulty.” That day, Tesla shares tumbled more than 15% for their worst session since 2020.\n\nDespite the recent nosedive, 45% of respondents said they anticipate Tesla shares will be at least 11% higher by the end of the calendar year. Around 36% expect the stock to tumble another 11% or further by year-end, while 19% see the stock staying within 10% of its price around $220.\n\nAfter a New York Times report last week unearthed criticisms of Musk’s team from members of Trump’s cabinet, the president offered a vote of confidence on Tuesday. Trump evaluated five Tesla models parked at the White House after the president said on social media that he would buy one as a symbol of support.\n\nTrump also said he would declare violence at Tesla dealerships to be acts of domestic terrorism.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/12/tesla-investor-survey-shows-85percent-believe-musks-politics-are-hurting-company.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/12/tesla-investor-survey-shows-85percent-believe-musks-politics-are-hurting-company.html)"

        "selftext": "he world’s most widely followed stock-market benchmark slid into a correction on Thursday, a drop that underscores how the two-year-long bull market is running out of steam in the early days of the Trump administration.\n\nThe move stems from investors’ growing pessimism about the whipsawing policy pronouncements from Washington over the past few weeks. On-again, off-again tariffs and mass layoffs of federal workers have fomented unease on Wall Street.\n\nOn Thursday, the S&P 500 fell 1.4 percent. After weeks of selling, the index is now down 10.1 percent from a peak that was reached less than one month ago and is in a correction — a Wall Street term for when an index falls 10 percent or more from its peak, and a line in the sand for investors worried about a sell-off gathering steam.\n\nOther major indexes, including the Russell 2000 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, had already fallen into correction before Thursday.\n\nThe deeper worry among investors is that uncertainty around the effects of Mr. Trump’s policies is causing consumers to spend less and discouraging businesses from investing. That reticence could, in turn, drive the economy into a downturn, forcing investors to re-evaluate company valuations.\n\n“I think what markets are telling us is that they are very concerned about the potential for a recession,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. “That is certainly not what markets expected going into 2025.”\n\nSo far, the administration has brushed off the market turmoil. Scott Bessent, secretary of the U.S. Treasury, said on Thursday that he was focused on the “real economy”, downplaying signals sent by business leaders and investors. “I’m not concerned about a little bit of volatility over three weeks,” he said.\n\nAs stocks have been falling in recent weeks, the Trump Administration has emphasized that its economic policies are designed to promote job growth over the long term, but could cause some market turmoil in the near term.\n\nSeema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the economy has already begun to be “negatively impacted.”\n\nThe pain has been acutely felt among the behemoth tech companies that had driven the market higher in recent years but have since reversed course. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index has fallen roughly 14 percent from its peak in December.\n\nThe sell-off has also spread to other corners of the market, signaling broader concerns than simply a re-pricing of highly valued technology companies. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which are typically more exposed to the ups and downs of the economy, has fallen 18 percent from its peak in November, close to a fully fledged bear market, defined as a drop of 20 percent or more from its peak.\n\nSectors of the stock market exposed to tariffs, like food producers, have slumped. The effects are being felt on other companies, like airlines, that are worried about a pullback among consumers should the economy enter a downturn.\n\n“So far in 2025, the U.S. economy has only faced headwinds,” Ms. Shah said.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Trump threatened to impose 200 percent tariffs on European wine and champagne, one day after the European Union announced retaliatory tariffs on imports of U.S. whiskey and several other American products. The president has already added tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and a wide swath of products from China.\n\nThe constantly moving goal posts have left investors so rattled that even recent good news about the economy hasn’t had a calming effect. On Thursday, a report on weekly unemployment claims came in lower than expected. On Wednesday, a better-than-expected reading of the Consumer Price Index had briefly helped bolster stocks.\n\nInvestors are worried that tariffs, once in full effect, will push prices higher — hurting business and consumers. Mr. Trump’s immigration policies and firings of federal employees through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency are also looming in the backdrop, as is the threat of an impending government shutdown.\n\n“The outlook for inflation depends more on tariffs, deportations and DOGE than the backward-looking data releases right now,” Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said on Thursday.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/business/sp-500-stocks-market-correction.html?smid=nytcore-android-share"

This paper establishes a regime where America is literally a global protection racket - \"pay up the tariffs or we throw you to the wolves.\"\n\nThis has a tinfoil hat flavor to all this, but just yesterday Ezra Klein's new episode dropped with Gillian Tett, a Financial Times reporter, and it is ALL about the Mar-A-Lago Accord.

There remain significant structural challenges with internationalizing the renminbi or inventing any sort of “BRICS currency,” so any such efforts will likely continue to fail, but alternative reserve assets like gold or cryptocurrencies will likely benefit.\n\nDionysis Partsinevelos at MSN breaks down the plan in a more terrifying detail, describing scenarios such as repricing Fort Knox gold (THAT'S why you've heard about it) and basically sabotaging the dollar and US bonds:\n\n[https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/the-mar-a-lago-accord-explained-trump-s-ultimate-plan-to-reshape-the-dollar-and-america-s-debt/ar-AA1zUMQ2](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/the-mar-a-lago-accord-explained-trump-s-ultimate-plan-to-reshape-the-dollar-and-america-s-debt/ar-AA1zUMQ2)\n\nBuckle up."

        "selftext": "There is a lot of talk, in this subreddit and just about everywhere, about how the tariffs are going to affect stock prices. I think the bigger factor is that Trumpism is not capitalism. This government has asserted its right to cancel contracts and grants, and the right to use all means at its disposal to impose policy on non-government entities. One example: NIH grants have been canceled because they were interpreted (apparently by someone who probably did not even read them, and certainly doesn’t understand them) as being no longer in line with the priorities of this government. These are multimillion dollar projects on topics like cancer, autism and shingles. They were funded after a careful competitive review by scientists, and they were stopped after much of the money was spent. It’s half-finished bridges. You can no doubt provide many examples yourself. If you can’t, ask in the comments. My point here is that under Trumpism the government will abandon contracts at will, and will use the threat of cancellation to micromanage state and local government, and corporations. \n\nThe cases of Columbia and Maine illustrate that this government has replaced the rule of law with rule by one man. In both cases, Trump asserted the right to dictate policy normally left to the University (regarding the limits of free speech on campus) or to the state (regarding trans-gender athletes), and found ways to enforce that. I don’t yet know of a case where this government directly managed a company, but I’m sure it will come; he has the tools (the threat of cancellation of government contracts, or exemptions from tariffs, to name two). The threat of arbitrary and capricious directives from this government, coupled with the inability to rely on contracts being honored, is going to destroy profits. Milton Friedman, the famed Chicago school economist, argued that democracy, economic freedom and the rule of law are essential for prosperity. We no longer have those things. Let me give you three examples. \n\nI have significant holdings in MRNA, Moderna. Their mRNA technology allows the rapid development of custom drugs, not only vaccines, but drugs to treat cancer and many other diseases. They demonstrated that they can deliver during the covid-19 pandemic, and many estimates hold that RNA vaccines saved over 10 million lives. This is a great American company, and it should be ascendent, but its stock price is currently beaten down by the reasonable expectation of politically based resistance to mRNA vaccines from the Trump administration. \n\nTSLA was one of last year’s magnificent seven and rose even higher when Trump was elected because of the expectation that the CEO Elon Musk’s close personal relationship with the president would pay off. Now, it has fallen along with Musk’s popularity. People realize that DOGE found precious little waste and fraud but compromised many valued functions of government. To my point here, the value of TSLA stock is entirely dependent on Trump’s continued favor. If there are many government contracts, it will probably recover. If there is a falling out after Trump finally finds it necessary to blame Musk for the obvious problems with DOGE, then it will not. In either case, this is not a free market. \n\nFinally, I want to mention Boeing. Trump personally announced on Friday that Boeing had been selected to build the F-47 jet fighter, a contract potentially worth $50 billion. So far so good, but he’s making it clear that he decides. I expect this contract to specify everything from who Boeing can purchase parts from, to DEI policies, to whether someone given the name Charles at birth can go by Chuck. \n\nTrumpism is government regulation on steroids.   "

        "selftext": "https://www.wired.com/story/trump-us-cloud-services-europe/\n\n\n#Trump’s Aggression Sours Europe on US Cloud Giants\n\n###Companies in the EU are starting to look for ways to ditch Amazon, Google, and Microsoft cloud services amid fears of rising security risks from the US. But cutting ties won’t be easy.\n\n> The global backlash against the second Donald Trump administration keeps on growing. Canadians have boycotted US-made products, anti–Elon Musk posters have appeared across London amid widespread Tesla protests, and European officials have drastically increased military spending as US support for Ukraine falters. Dominant US tech services may be the next focus.\n\n> There are early signs that some European companies and governments are souring on their use of American cloud services provided by the three so-called hyperscalers. Between them, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) host vast swathes of the internet and keep thousands of businesses running. However, some organizations appear to be reconsidering their use of these companies’ cloud services—including servers, storage, and databases—citing uncertainties around privacy and data access fears under the Trump administration.\n\n> “There’s a huge appetite in Europe to de-risk or decouple the over-dependence on US tech companies, because there is a concern that they could be weaponized against European interests,” says Marietje Schaake, a nonresident fellow at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center and a former, decade-long member of the European Parliament.\n\n> The moves may already be underway. On March 18, politicians in the Netherlands House of Representatives passed eight motions asking the government to reduce reliance on US tech companies and move to European alternatives. Days before, more than 100 organizations signed an open letter to European officials calling for the continent to become “more technologically independent” and saying the status quo creates “security and reliability risks.”\n\n> Two European-based cloud service companies, Exoscale and Elastx, tell WIRED they have seen an uptick in potential customers looking to abandon US cloud providers over the last two weeks—with some already starting to make the jump. Multiple technology advisers say they are having widespread discussions about what it would take to uproot services, data, and systems.\n\n> “We have more demand from across Europe,” says Mathias Nöbauer, the CEO of Swiss-based hosting provider Exoscale, adding there has been an increase in new customers seeking to move away from cloud giants. “Some customers were very explicit,” Nöbauer says. “Especially customers from Denmark being very explicit that they want to move away from US hyperscalers because of the US administration and what they said about Greenland.”\n\n> “It's a big worry about the uncertainty around everything. And from the Europeans’ perspective—that the US is maybe not on the same team as us any longer,” says Joakim Öhman, the CEO of Swedish cloud provider Elastx. “Those are the drivers that bring people or organizations to look at alternatives.”\n\n> Concerns have been raised about the current data-sharing agreement between the EU and US, which is designed to allow information to move between the two continents while protecting people’s rights. Multiple previous versions of the agreement have been struck down by European courts. At the end of January, Trump fired three Democrats from the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), which helps manage the current agreement. The move could undermine or increase uncertainty around the agreement. In addition, Öhman says, he has heard concerns from firms about the CLOUD Act, which can allow US law enforcement to subpoena user data from tech companies, potentially including data that is stored in systems outside of the US.\n\n> Dave Cottlehuber, the founder of SkunkWerks, a small tech infrastructure firm in Austria, says he has been moving the company’s few servers and databases away from US providers to European services since the start of the year. “First and foremost, it’s about values,” Cottlehuber says. “For me, privacy is a right not a privilege.” Cottlehuber says the decision to move is easier for a small business such as his, but he argues it removes some taxes that are paid to the Trump administration. “The best thing I can do is to remove that small contribution of mine, and also at the same time, make sure that my customers’ privacy is respected and preserved,” Cottlehuber says.\n\n> Steffen Schmidt, the CEO of Medicusdata, a company that provides text-to-speech services to doctors and hospitals in Europe, says that having data in Europe has always “been a must,” but his customers have been asking for more in recent weeks. “Since the beginning of 2025, in addition to data residency guarantees, customers have actively asked us to use cloud providers that are natively European companies,” Schmidt says, adding that some of his services have been moved to Nöbauer’s Exoscale.\n\n> Harry Staight, a spokesperson for AWS, says it is “not accurate” that customers are moving from AWS to EU alternatives. “Our customers have control over where they store their data and how it is encrypted, and we make the AWS Cloud sovereign-by-design,” Straight says. “AWS services support encryption with customer managed keys that are inaccessible to AWS, which means customers have complete control of who accesses their data.” Staight says the membership of the PCLOB “does not impact” the agreements around EU-US data sharing and that the CLOUD Act has “additional safeguards for cloud content.” Google and Microsoft declined to comment.\n\n> The potential shift away from US tech firms is not just linked to cloud providers. Since January 15, visitors to the European Alternatives website increased more than 1,200 percent. The site lists everything from music streaming services to DDoS protection tools, says Marko Saric, a cofounder of European cloud analytics service Plausible. “We can certainly feel that something is going on,” Saric says, claiming that during the first 18 days of March the company has “beaten” the net recurring revenue growth it saw in January and February. “This is organic growth which cannot be explained by any seasonality or our activities,” he says.\n\n> While there are signs of movement, the impact is likely to be small—at least for now. Around the world, governments and businesses use multiple cloud services—such as authentication measures, hosting, data storage, and increasingly data centers providing AI processing—from the big three cloud and tech service providers. Cottlehuber says that, for large businesses, it may take many months, if not longer, to consider what needs to be moved, the risks involved, plus actually changing systems. “What happens if you have a hundred petabytes of storage, it's going to take years to move over the internet,” he says.\n\n> For years, European companies have struggled to compete with the likes of Google, Microsoft, and Amazon’s cloud services and technical infrastructure, which make billions every year. It may also be difficult to find similar services on the scale of those provided by alternative European cloud firms.\n\n> “If you are deep into the hyperscaler cloud ecosystem, you’ll struggle to find equivalent services elsewhere,” says Bert Hubert, an entrepreneur and former government regulator, who says he has heard of multiple new cloud migrations to US firms being put on hold or reconsidered. Hubert has argued that it is no longer “safe” for European governments to be moved to US clouds and that European alternatives can’t properly compete. “We sell a lot of fine wood here in Europe. But not that much furniture,” he says. However, that too could change.\n\n> Schaake, the former member of the European Parliament, says a combination of new investments, a different approach to buying public services, and a Europe-first approach or investing in a European technology stack could help to stimulate any wider moves on the continent. “The dramatic shift of the Trump administration is very tangible,” Schaake says. “The idea that anything could happen and that Europe should fend for itself is clear. Now we need to see the same kind of pace and leadership that we see with defense to actually turn this into meaningful action.”\n\n**Credit:** *(Matt Burgess is a senior writer at WIRED focused on information security, privacy, and data regulation in Europe.

        "selftext": "White House aide Peter Navarro claimed Sunday that President Donald Trump’s new tariffs would raise more than $6 trillion in federal revenue over the next decade, a figure that experts said would almost certainly represent the largest peacetime tax hike in modern U.S. history.\n\nAppearing on Fox News, Navarro said the president’s tariffs on auto imports, set to take effect Wednesday, would raise $100 billion per year. Meanwhile, a regime of additional tariffs — details of which have yet to be released — would raise another $600 billion per year, or $6 trillion over the next decade, Navarro said.\n\nNavarro’s remarks suggest Trump is preparing dramatic new measures for Wednesday, which the president has referred to as “Liberation Day.” Navarro is known to be among the most hawkish voices in the president’s inner circle on trade, and it was not immediately clear if he was speaking to official administration policy or for one side of an internal debate over the tariffs. But Navarro’s comments are sure to rattle markets amid intensifying fears about the global trade war that Trump’s tariffs have started.\n\nAlso speaking on Fox News on Sunday, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, declined to outline Trump’s plans. Hassett is widely regarded as more skeptical of tariffs than Navarro.\n\n“I can’t give you any forward-looking guidance on what’s going to happen this week,” Hassett said. “The president has got a heck of a lot of analysis before him, and he’s going to make the right choice, I’m sure.”\n\nTariffs are taxes imposed on foreign goods imported into the United States. A tariff regime that generated $600 billion per year would amount to the biggest increase in federal tax revenue since World War II, according to Jessica Riedl, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a center-right think tank.\n\nBy way of comparison, the U.S. is set to spend roughly $900 billion per year on the Pentagon this year. Extending Trump’s 2017 tax cuts is projected to cost roughly $4 trillion over the next decade, adding roughly $400 billion a year to the national debt.\n\nGenerating $600 billion a year in fresh revenue theoretically would cover the cost of those tax cuts and then some. But economists say new taxes of that magnitude also could deepen instability on Wall Street and further increase the risk of a U.S. recession, and experts are extremely skeptical the tariffs would raise as much as Navarro claimed.\n\nThe Trump administration argues that steep tariffs are necessary to bring production and manufacturing jobs back to the United States. “The message is tariffs are tax cuts. Tariffs are jobs. Tariffs are national security,” Navarro said. “Tariffs will make America great again.”\n\nNavarro did not disclose details of the additional tariffs coming Wednesday, but Trump [has in recent days revived the idea](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/03/29/republicans-trump-tariffs-trade-war/?itid=ap_jeffstein_2) of imposing a single universal rate on all imports to the United States, regardless of the product or the country of origin. During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump proposed setting this flat tariff rate as high as 20 percent.\n\nBecause the U.S. imports more than $3 trillion worth of goods per year, simple math suggests that a 20 percent import tax on all goods could raise close to $600 billion in annual revenue. However, economists argue that such a tax ultimately would raise far less because the costs would be passed on to American consumers in the form of higher prices and consumers would therefore purchase fewer imported goods. In an interview with NBC on Saturday, Trump nodded to this effect, [saying](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/29/trump-auto-tariffs-prices-rise/) he “couldn’t care less” if his auto tariffs raise prices, because higher prices on imports would encourage people to buy American-made cars instead.\n\nA universal flat tariff has been heavily criticized by economists in both parties, who argue that it would raise prices indiscriminately, striking even some goods — such as food and cheap consumer electronics — that either cannot be produced in America or make little sense to produce domestically.\n\nThis month, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent outlined a more moderate approach to “Liberation Day” that calls for the United States to determine a new tariff policy for its each of its key trading partners, leaving room for negotiations and dealmaking. But Trump has told advisers in recent days that he is wary of being insufficiently ambitious with his tariff policy, and it remains unclear precisely what Wednesday will bring."

        "selftext": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Sunday that his involvement in the Trump administration could be hurting the automaker’s stock price.\n\nSpeaking at a town hall event in Wisconsin, Musk said his role with the so-called Department of Government Efficiency — which is pushing for widespread government job cuts — is creating backlash against his electric car company and hurting the stock.\n\n“What they’re trying to do is put massive pressure on me, and Tesla I guess, to ... stop doing this,” Musk said, according to Bloomberg News. “My Tesla stock and the stock of everyone who holds Tesla has gone, went roughly in half. I mean it’s a big deal.”\n\nShares of Tesla entered Monday already down more than 34% year to date, and the stock has been cut nearly in half from its peak in December. Shares were down an additional 6% in premarket trading Monday.\n\nThe drop for the stock could be a “buying opportunity” for the long term, said Musk, who was in Wisconsin ahead of a state supreme court election there. Musk has campaigned for the conservative candidate and spent more than $12 million on the race, in addition to giving $1 million each to two voters at Sunday’s rally for signing a petition against “activist judges.”\n\nThe slumping stock isn’t the only sign of public anger with Musk for his political work. Protesters demonstrated at Tesla dealerships over the weekend, and there have been reports of vandalism against vehicles and dealers across the country.\n\nMusk’s role in politics is not limited to DOGE. He publicly campaigned with Trump in 2024 and has been a regular presence at the White House since the new administration took over in January. He also regularly comments on many different political topics on X, the social media company he owns.\n\nThe CEO’s rising political profile comes amid signs that Tesla’s core business is slowing. The automaker’s vehicle deliveries declined in 2024, and preliminary data has shown that sales are down again early this year, especially in Europe. In a note to clients Sunday, investment firm Stifel trimmed its price target on the stock and lowered its sales projections for Tesla.\n\nMusk’s political dealings may not be the only reason for Tesla’s struggles. Other U.S. auto stocks have also labored in recent weeks, partly because of threats of higher tariffs on imported goods into the U.S. and retaliation from overseas trading partners, adding uncertainty to an industry whose supply chains are tightly woven among the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\n\nSource: [Elon Musk says backlash against DOGE government cuts hurts Tesla stock](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/31/elon-musk-says-people-against-his-doge-cuts-are-trying-to-pressure-tesla.html)"

        "selftext": "Here is my way of trying to find alpha in an erratic stock market - how I'm trading the US tourism dip.\n\n**1. Canada is the US's largest source of tourism**: In 2024, 20 million Canadian tourists visited the US, spent $20.5 billion, and supported 140,000 US jobs. Canada's population is 40 million, so 50% of the entire country visited, and the US had 77 million tourists so 1 country is contributing 26% of visits.\n\n**2. Recent US policies is leading to a tourism boycott from Canadians, and the rest of the world**: Tourists are boycotting US tourism due to tariffs, annexation threats, new travel barriers, and stories of visitors being unlawfully detained with no due process (in March a Canadian citizen was denied entry due to an expired visa, while this was a worker and not a tourist, instead of being allowed to return to Canada, as is the norm, she was shackled in chains and sent to a private ICE facility for 2 weeks without being able to contact a lawyer or get a bed).\n\n**3. Analysts previously predicted policies would decrease tourism by 5%, new numbers released this week show that it's 14x higher:** For Canada alone (26% of US's entire tourism industry with 20 million visitors) - airline travel is **down** **70%**, land travel is **down** **45%**, and **85%+** of tourists survey say they cancelled their US trips.\n\n**4. Here's how I'm planning on using this information to make stock trades into specific companies both long and short:** I'm shorting airlines that have high exposure to Can-US routes (it's been reported that airlines are slashing these routes due to 0 demand, and they is no clear way they can cover this revenue gap with a lower utilized fleet). I'm shorting select hospitality chains (hotels, restaurants) with high exposure/retail foot print in US states that border Canada like Niagara Falls. The US travel association says that even just a 10% dip in tourists will lead to $2 billion in economic losses and 140,000 jobs at risk (assuming 70% decrease from air travel happens across the board, that's $14b), I expect hospitality to have lower revenues. I'm shorting all non-essential or higher price retailers with a big footprint in hostility states, all these workers being laid off by lack of tourism + the gov worker job cuts won't have as much to spend (not my specific trade, but an example would be short Target, long Dollar General).\n\nI'm long, and buying, non-American/Europe hotel chains and travel booking platforms that get most of their revenue outside the US, as I expect Canadian and international tourists to concentrate their spend to Europe/Asia/Oceania travel this summer.\n\n**Edit 5. How do the European/International figures play?**\n\nIt's important to note that the Canadian tourism numbers dipped after the policies that happened in point 2. And we're seeing what those numbers are a few months later now. The US admin is rolling out these policies across the board tomorrow during \"Liberation Day\". The point here is that we won't see the true vector of an internal tourism boycott both in terms of magnitude and direction until the policies that were enacted on Canada are enacted globally, and consumers have time to adjust behaviour. But if the Canadian consumer is any indication, I have more conviction in my trades. **A glimpse into this being a trend is a French travel company reporting to Bloomberg their Europe to US travel bookings are down 25%.**\n\n**Edit 6. Example of the airline play**\n\nYes I know US airlines are already down a lot. Rode that wave and exited my shorts. Now I'm shorting Air Canada and ONEX (parent company of WestJet), since they have much more exposure to US-Can routes, and are cutting routes dramatically with no increase in capacity elsewhere\n\nAlso looking to short airline maitence companies, the food suppliers specific to flight food, and fuel refineries/storage those two airlines use, and retail stores with large exposure to airports that only see US/Canada travel.\n\nBut going long on regional air craft hangers since their smaller fleets are used the most for US/Canada travel, while their bigger fleets will still be active for the europe/asia flight routes that havn't seen impact on demand.\n\nWould like to hear what everyone thinks about this trade play. Thanks!\n\n**Source for numbers used**\n\n* [https://theconversation.com/tourists-are-cancelling-trips-to-the-us-heres-how-this-could-affect-its-economy-252858](https://theconversation.com/tourists-are-cancelling-trips-to-the-us-heres-how-this-could-affect-its-economy-252858)\n* [https://www.ustravel.org/press/potential-results-decline-canadian-travel-united-states](https://www.ustravel.org/press/potential-results-decline-canadian-travel-united-states)\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/canada/air-canada-flights-seats-us.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/canada/air-canada-flights-seats-us.html)\n* [https://financialpost.com/news/canadian-us-shopping-trips-dwindle](https://financialpost.com/news/canadian-us-shopping-trips-dwindle)\n* [https://www.discovercars.com/blog/us-travel-tourism-statistics](https://www.discovercars.com/blog/us-travel-tourism-statistics)\n* [https://globalnews.ca/news/11080371/canadian-woman-detained-ice-example-immigration-border/](https://globalnews.ca/news/11080371/canadian-woman-detained-ice-example-immigration-border/)\n* [https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/2028592/us-tourism-suffer-billion-drop-donald-trump](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/2028592/us-tourism-suffer-billion-drop-donald-trump)\n* [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-01/european-tourists-start-avoiding-the-us-as-unknown-territory](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-01/european-tourists-start-avoiding-the-us-as-unknown-territory)"

Those popular consumer electronics items generally aren’t made in the US. Setting up domestic manufacturing would take years.\n\nThe products that won’t be subject to Trump’s new tariffs also include machines used to make semiconductors. That would be important for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which has announced a major new investment in the US as well as other chipmakers.\n\nThe tariff reprieve may prove fleeting. The exclusions stem from the initial order, which prevented extra tariffs on certain sectors from stacking cumulatively on top of the country-wide rates. The exclusion is a sign that the products may soon be subject to a different tariff, albeit almost surely a lower one for China.\n\nOne such exclusion was for semiconductors, to which Trump has regularly pledged to apply a specific tariff. He hasn’t yet done so but the latest exclusions appear to correspond with that exemption. Trump’s sectoral tariffs have so far been set at 25%, though it’s not clear what his rate on semiconductors and related products would be.\n\n"

He doesn't care he's being hunted down.\n\nAlso, to make this even worse, CPI will not come back good. The dollar index will continue to fall, exacerbated by China and other countries dumping US bonds. Currency devalue + tariffs will cause import costs to go up and push the cost onto the consumers, further raising CPI.

And he made it clear he wasn't yet sure whether the inflationary effects from tariffs would be temporary or long-lasting.\n\n\"Tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation,\" he said, but \"the inflationary effects could also be more persistent.\"\n\nPowell also underscored the Fed's obligation is to keep long-term inflation expectations well anchored and to prevent a one-time price increase associated with higher tariffs from becoming an ongoing inflation problem.\n\nAll of this seemingly hit a nerve with the president, who spent much of Thursday lashing out at Powell on social media and during a press event in the Oval Office.\n\n\"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!\" the president wrote on Truth Social. Trump said Powell \"is always TOO LATE AND WRONG\" and should be cutting interest rates alongside other central banks.\n\nAt the White House later on Thursday, Trump reiterated he was \"not happy\" with Powell and that Powell would leave his position \"if I ask him to.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Trump has for months privately discussed firing Powell, but he hasn’t made a final decision about whether to try to oust him before his term ends in May 2026.\n\nPowell has shown no signs of blinking. On Wednesday, he again reiterated the independence of his institution and his own job, saying it’s \"a matter of law,\" and pledged not to act in response to any political pressure."

The prevailing trend of the last decade – a belief in the continued success of US markets far beyond that of other regions – is over, according to the Bank of America’s latest survey.\nOver the past two months, fund managers have dumped US equities at a record pace as President Trump’s tariff war and uncertainty over global economic stability continue. For those watching closely, it should not come as a shock, although it has happened perhaps a little faster than anticipated.\n\nWhile it has come to feel like business as usual, US exceptionalism isn’t the historic status quo. In the 1980s, for example, the rapid rise of Japanese stocks challenged the US dominance of global markets.\nTom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity Personal Investing, explains that ultimately, the stock market bubble was over-inflated and had a long way to fall – a scenario today’s US market is particularly vulnerable to.\nOne of the most notable pinpricks came at the start of this year with the release of DeepSeek, a sophisticated AI tool developed in China. The extremely cheap development cost of the model has sparked concerns that the AI moat of the American tech giants may not be as wide as had been assumed.\n\nSince 2012, average earnings from US stocks have risen 145pc – over the same period, European and UK markets have each seen earnings increase by just 37pc and 30pc, respectively.\n\nHugh Gimber, global market strategist at JP Morgan, says: “Technology has been the leading sector globally and the US has been overweight in that sector. In an environment where technology [stocks] have been standout it has been hard for other regions to out perform.”\nHowever, the performance gap between the Magnificent Seven (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta and Nvidia) and the rest of the S&P 500 has narrowed of late. A year ago, the tech giants were outgrowing the rest of the US market by 30pc, a figure that has plummeted to just 6pc. That is expected to halve to just 3pc in 2026.\n\nThe upset is apparent in other metrics, too. While the Magnificent Seven accounted for 50pc of the S&P 500’s earnings in 2024, this share is projected to fall to a third for 2025.\n\nAll of this adds up to a simple fact: US equities are unlikely to outperform the rest of the world to the extent that they have done in the recent past.\nIn fact, Mr Stevenson warns they may underperform.\nMarkets are also becoming suspicious of US government debt, which could have dramatic consequences for the stock market.\nMr Gimber explains: “One of the big parts behind the US economic outperformance is the size of the government deficit that has been running.\n“This has been an expansion built on US government debt, and although levels are still rising the market is getting wary of US government debt, especially in the context of inflationary pressure from tariffs.”\n"

If Powell is pushed out “this credibility will be harmed even more, with developments in the bond market.”\n\nThe result would be higher costs to service the debt and “a profound disorganization of the country’s economy,” Lombard said, adding that the consequences would bring the US sooner or later to talks to end the tensions.\n\nLombard’s comments come after Trump, frustrated with Powell’s caution to cut US interest rates, posted on social media Thursday that Powell’s “termination couldn’t come quickly enough.” It wasn’t clear whether he meant he wanted to fire Powell or was eager for the end of his term, which is May 2026. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Friday Trump was studying whether he could fire him.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron has opposed Trump on a series of issues including Ukraine, trade and even offered refuge in France for US-based scientists whose federal research funding has been cut.\n\nEven so, Lombard’s comments are unusually direct about US domestic matters.\n\nOn tariffs, France’s finance minister said the 10% tariffs Trump has imposed on imports from the EU don’t constitute “common ground” and that Europe’s goal is for a free trade zone with the US.\n\nThe 10% level is “a huge increase that isn’t sustainable for the US economy and represents major risks for global trade,” Lombard said.\n\nThe finance minister also called on European CEOs to show “patriotism” and work with their governments so the region doesn’t lose out.\n\nOn Thursday, French billionaire Bernard Arnault, whose group LVMH owns Champagne labels like Moët & Chandon and Veuve Clicquot as well as Hennessy Cognac, seemed to suggest that EU leaders weren’t pushing hard enough for an accord on tariffs."

If each sailing was carrying 8,000 to 10,000 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units), that would equal a decline in freight traffic of between 640,000-800,000 containers, and lead to decreased crane operations at the ports, lower fees that could be collected, and declines in container pick-ups and transports by trucks, rails, and to warehouses for storage.\n\nBooking volumes from the last week of March to first week of April across global and U.S. trade lanes plummeted. There were sharp decreases in bookings across several categories, including apparel & accessories; and wool, fabrics & textiles, both down over 50%. Major product categories from China that are moved in containers include apparel, toys, furniture, and sports equipment, all of which are subject to steep tariffs."

Here are four:\n\nMore expensive stuff, and less choice of stuff. Increasing saving means reducing consumption. The tariffs amount to the largest tax increase in decades, which counts as government “saving”—as well as pushing up the price for almost everything imported.\n\nHigher interest rates. The capital inflows that offset the trade deficit help fund a big chunk of federal government borrowing. Slash the trade deficit and the net inflow of foreign money dries up. Bond yields will need to rise to attract domestic savers to buy Treasurys instead of stocks or corporate bonds, which will hit share prices and raise the cost of borrowing for companies.\n\nLower stock prices. Only a small chunk of foreign investments goes into building factories. If there were more foreign direct investment, it could finance at least some of the reconstruction of manufacturing. But we’ve assumed Trump succeeds in shrinking the trade and current-account deficits, so there will be less foreign money coming in (remember: balance). So more foreign factory building means less foreign buying of stocks and bonds, so lower stock prices.\n\nA weaker dollar. In economic theory the dollar is the variable that moves when savings and investment don’t balance. If the U.S. saves too little to cover its investment, the dollar should weaken to make U.S. investments more attractive to foreigners.\n\nIn practice the dollar has been in demand for foreign reserves and for use in trade, as well as a safe place to stash the world’s savings. All three are now being questioned: reserve holders worry they could be cut off from their reserves the way Russia was, trade is likely to shrink thanks to tariffs, and investors are worried that U.S. law might no longer be the reliable protector of their assets.\n\n(End quote)\n\nThis is the most important part, and the full article under paywall can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/who-will-pay-the-price-for-trumps-economic-goals-37a7df15?st=8oqUME&reflink=article_copyURL_share\n"

Keep in context that this is exactly a four month timeframe, but to be far that’s also because that’s literal present timeframe we have so far. \n\nJan–Apr 2025\t~10.8% - Trump’s tariffs and political pressure on the Fed, global de-dollarization concerns. \n\nJul–Nov 1985\t~10.2% - Post-Plaza Accord (U.S. and allies coordinated to weaken the dollar)\n\nSep 2000–Jan 2001 ~ 9.6% - Start of dot-com crash; capital fleeing U.S. tech bubble\n\nApr–Aug 2008\t ~ 8.8% - Global financial crisis buildup; Fed rate cuts and recession fears.\n\nApr–Jul 2020\t~ 4.1%\t- COVID-19 stimulus surge; fear of inflation and dovish Fed.\n\nWe are in unprecedented times. So the question is “Now what?” “What comes next?” In economics you always have to think about what comes after. \n"

It’s not long since investors were anticipating a so-called Trump trade, essentially turbocharging US exceptionalism, but now it looks more like a sell-America trade.\n\nAnd that’s just part of an even broader and likely painful shift. The role of US households as goods-buyers of last resort for the global economy, and the American military as linchpin of security and political alliances, are being called into question too.\n\nCompounding the concerns, Trump is now escalating his war of words against the Fed, demanding immediate interest-rate cuts. Lawyers doubt he’s authorized to fire Powell. But the damage to investor confidence in the central bank’s independence — part of the bedrock appeal of US markets, along with a wider faith in the rule of law — may already be done."

        "selftext": "\n\nFrom: https://www.timesunion.com/state/article/schumer-says-democrats-force-vote-end-trump-20286193.php \n\n\nALBANY — Democrats plan to force a floor vote in the U.S. Senate next week to reverse recent tariffs imposed by President Donald J. Trump on imports from other countries. \n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer told reporters in Albany Monday that he thinks Democrats can secure the four Republican votes necessary for the resolution to pass.\n\n“American families, restaurants and manufacturers will be able to breathe a sigh of relief if we can get that done,” Schumer said.\nA similar resolution sponsored this month by U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, wound up passing the Senate after four Republicans crossed party lines to support it. Schumer is trying to repeat that result.\nThe resolution would reverse the blanket 10% tariff on all goods imported into the U.S. by ending the emergency declaration Trump has issued to impose them. It would also prevent Trump from using the same declaration to impose new tariffs.\n“We believe the administration’s claim of an emergency is not justified,” Schumer said.\nBut the harder fight — and one in which Schumer has no control — is in the House of Representatives, where a majority of lawmakers would have to approve the resolution for it to become binding.\nRepublican leadership in the house, including Rep. Elise Stefanik from the North Country, has made clear that they don’t plan to stand in the way of Trump’s tariffs. Some lawmakers have offered support for his economic strategy.\nThe goal of the tariffs is to pressure other countries into trade agreements more favorable to the U.S. while providing a disincentive for consumers to purchase products imported from other countries.\n“I strongly support President Trump’s America First economic policies to strengthen American manufacturing and create millions of American jobs,” Stefanik said earlier this month.\n\nStefanik is one of seven Republicans that represent New York in the House, where Republicans currently hold a seven-member majority.\nSchumer employed a strategy on Monday that’s been used by several other Democrats from New York in recent weeks to apply pressure to Republicans, framing them as the final arbiters on whether prices will climb because of tariffs.\nHe called on the Republicans representing New York in Congress to bring his planned resolution to the floor of their chamber for consideration.\n“If those seven went to (House Speaker Mike) Johnson and said to put it on the floor, he’d be under real pressure to do it,” Schumer said.\n\nBut at least one Republican is siding with Stefanik on Trump’s tariffs. Rep. Mike Lawler has said that Republicans are focused on other actions to lower costs as well, like removing regulations for businesses and boosting domestic energy production.\n“This is about leveling the playing field, bringing tariffs down across the globe,” Lawler said in a televised town hall earlier this month.\nThat makes Schumer’s request unlikely at this point, leaving the tariffs in place. They’ve already started to have an impact on certain industries, including restaurants, which may have to raise their prices to maintain profits.\n“Tariffs on food and beverages will place an additional strain on restaurants, ultimately leading to higher prices that will be passed on to consumers,” said Melissa Fleischut, president of the New York State Restaurant Association.\n\nOther industries also haven’t been immune to the tariffs. That includes Latham Pool, a local business that happens to be the largest manufacturer of in-ground residential pools in North America. \nTariffs on aluminum and steel have had the most impact on the business, said Scott Rajeski, the company’s CEO.\n“We’ve created an ecosystem where we use the Canadian operations and our upstate New York operations to ship goods back and forth between the two countries,” Rajeski said. “It’s a difficult situation.”\n\nBoth chambers of Congress are scheduled to return to Washington, D.C., next week after two weeks off from session.\n"

        "selftext": "Tesla reported a miss on the top and bottom lines in its first-quarter earnings report on Tuesday as automotive revenue plunged 20% from a year earlier.\n\nHere are the key numbers compared with LSEG expectations.\n\n* **Earnings per share**: 27 cents adjusted vs. 39 cents estimated\n* **Revenue**: $19.34 billion vs. $21.11 billion estimated\n\nTotal revenue slid 9% from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue dropped 20% to $14 billion from $17.4 billion in the same period last year.\n\nTesla said one reason for the decline was the need to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV. The company also pointed to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit.\n\nNet income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago.\n\nIt’s been a brutal start to the year for Tesla, with CEO Elon Musk spending much of his time in President Donald Trump’s White House, overseeing an effort to dramatically downsize the federal government. The president’s sweeping tariffs plan has led to concerns that costs will increase for parts and materials crucial for electric vehicle production, including manufacturing equipment, automotive glass, printed circuit boards and battery cells.\n\nTesla shares are down 41% so far in 2025, and suffered their worst quarterly drop since 2022 in the period that ended in March. The stock was little changed in extended trading on Tuesday.\n\nThe company refrained from promising growth this year and said it will “revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.”\n\nIn its shareholder deck, Tesla cautioned investors that “uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers.” The company said this “dynamic,” and “changing political sentiment” could have a meaningful near-term impact on demand for its products.\n\nTesla has faced widespread protests in the U.S. and Europe, where Musk has actively supported Germany’s far-right AfD party. Earlier this month, the company reported a 13% decline in first quarter deliveries from a year earlier to 336,681.\n\nTesla has been struggling to keep pace with lower-cost competitors in China, and is a laggard in the robotaxi market, which is currently dominated in the U.S. by Alphabet’s Waymo. The company has promised to launch its first driverless ride-hailing offering in Austin, Texas, in June.\n\nThe company reassured investors on Tuesday that it remains on track for a “pilot launch” in Austin by that point, and to begin building its humanoid robots on a pilot production line in Fremont, California, this year.\n\nOperating income in the quarter slid 66% to $400 million from $1.17 billion a year earlier, resulting in a 2.1% operating margin. The company cited an increase in expenses tied to artificial intelligence projects as one factor in the decline.\n\nThe company would have lost money on automotive sales without environmental regulatory credits during the quarter. Revenue from the credits, which Tesla receives for selling fully electric vehicles, increased to $595 million from $432 million in the same quarter last year.\n\nEnergy generation and storage revenue jumped 67% in the quarter to $2.73 billion from $1.64 billion a year ago. The company said growth in AI infrastructure is “creating an outsized opportunity for our Energy storage products to stabilize the grid, shift energy when it is needed most and provide additional power capacity.”\n\nTesla uses foreign suppliers for its energy business. The company said “increasing tariffs may cause market volatility and near-term impacts to supply and demand.”\n\nSource: [Tesla (TSLA) earnings report Q1 2025](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/22/tesla-tsla-earnings-report-q1-2025.html)"

The dream of creating more manufacturing jobs, however, “is not going to come true.”\n\n“These jobs are not coming back to America,” Griffin said. “And to be clear, with an unemployment rate of 4%, America has moved on.”\n\nThe Citadel billionaire, who earlier this week said the trade war has devolved into a “nonsensical” place, has warned that the US is putting its global brand at risk as a result of the tariff policies. On Friday, he said the administration has embraced a transactional mindset that runs contrary to the best interests of the country. \n\nSpeaking as part of Stanford’s “View From the Top” series in Silicon Valley, Griffin argued the US should try to play to its strengths, such as creating intellectual property and content, rather than bringing back jobs in factories that are rapidly automating their production anyway. \n\nKen Griffin Criticizes Trump Tariffs: ‘These Jobs Are Not Coming Back’ https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-25/ken-griffin-says-trump-tariffs-won-t-bring-back-manufacturing-jobs"

He projected a 35% decrease in cargo arrivals compared to the same time last year.\n\nPorts Handle Over 30% of U.S. Container Trade: The Port of Los Angeles and the neighboring Port of Long Beach together process 31% of all U.S. shipping container imports and exports (17% and 14%, respectively), making their slowdown a critical national issue.\n\nWider Economic Fallout Includes Job Loss and Supply Chain Slowdown: 1 in 9 jobs in the Los Angeles region is tied to port activity. Experts estimate a 9-12 month long recovery if tariffs are reversed today. As maritime traffic and cargo volume decline, the trucking industry and broader supply chain are also slowing, threatening small businesses and consumer goods availability nationwide. \n\n—————————————————————————-\n\nFULL ARTICLE:\n\nBy Juliette Kayyem\n\nA drop in maritime traffic suggests that the worst is yet to come.\n\nStock markets plunged for days after President Donald Trump announced steep tariffs on imports from around the world. The sell-off ebbed only when he suspended most, but not all, of the new measures for 90 days. The ticker tape is just one indicator of an economy, and other signs are growing more and more ominous—including at the Port of Los Angeles, where high tariffs on China are crushing maritime traffic. “Essentially all shipments out of China for major retailers and manufacturers have ceased,” Eugene Seroka, the executive director of the port, said on April 24.\n\nTrump views tariffs as essential to rebuilding the manufacturing economy that the United States once had. But his erratic tariff announcements have badly disrupted the economy that the country has today, and that pain is already being felt in the world of logistics.\n\n“These are big, massive bullwhips that have not been seen since COVID,” Evan Smith, the CEO of the supply-chain-management company Altana Technologies, told me. “The tariffs themselves are a shock to the system, and the shock is echoed and amplified across the entire chain. Even if there is resolution, it will take nine to 12 months to work out these bumps.”\n\nThe Port of Los Angeles, the busiest in the Western Hemisphere, processes about 17 percent of everything the United States imports or exports in shipping containers. The adjoining Port of Long Beach accounts for another 14 percent. Over the years, a whole ecosystem has arisen to support the loading and unloading of the cars, clothes, electronic gadgets, and other things that people want. There are workers and warehouses, trucks and loading pads, security structures and rail lines.\nSeroka estimated that cargo arrivals would soon be down 35 percent over the same time last year. At the moment, the drop in traffic seems likelier to accelerate than to reverse. \n\nThe number of cargo ships canceling port calls or entire voyages is on the rise. A number of shipments now under way were instigated before Trump’s so-called Liberation Day tariff announcement, on April 2. According to Forto, a cargo-management and -tracking company, reservations for shipping products must normally be placed two weeks before a cargo vessel launches. The trip from China from California typically takes two or more additional weeks. In other words, the full effects of U.S. tariff policies on maritime traffic may not be apparent for some time.\n\nThe economy, and the supply chains that allow it to function, can adjust fairly quickly to certain shocks, including weather disasters and even a pandemic. Early in the COVID shutdowns, toilet paper was in short supply as Americans spent more time at home and less at workplaces and schools. The problem eased as manufacturers ramped up production, transportation systems adapted, and consumer anxiety decreased.\nBut Trump’s trade war is different because it is unpredictable and indefinite. Even if he were to renounce tariffs tomorrow, Trump has already shaken global confidence in American economic-policy making. No one can comfortably make business decisions based on what he does. Unless the Republican-controlled Congress steps in to quickly take away the president’s ability to impose import duties at will, a failed effortso far, even foreign trading partners who believe they have a deal with the United States could be at risk of capricious new taxes on their products.\n\nTariffs don’t just reduce the flow of goods coming into the country; they also cause an atrophying of the logistics system that moves products into, out of, and around the United States. “Less cargo volume, less jobs. That’s the rule here,” Mario Cordero, CEO of the Port of Long Beach, said recently, describing how one in nine jobs in the greater Los Angeles region arises directly or indirectly from its ports. “Port complexes are like your baby toe on your foot,” Peter Neffenger, the former commander of the Coast Guard sector that includes Los Angeles and Long Beach, told me. “You don’t think about it until you break it one day and realize, ‘I can’t walk.’”\n\nLike the shipping business into and out of Los Angeles, the nationwide trucking industry is slowing down, because drivers have a lot less cargo to move. Without inventory arriving or en route, small businesses will falter; bigger industries will shrink; shelves will be empty.\nThis week, Trump blamed former President Joe Biden, rather than his own policies, for the recent turmoil on Wall Street. What’s happening in Los Angeles suggests that, if anything, financial markets have yet to fully price in how much Trump’s tariff war is hurting the economy. The stock market goes up and down. Maritime indicators keep on sinking.\n\n————————————————————————-\n\n12 MONTH POSSIBLE TIMELINE  CHATGPT (updated)\n\nHere’s a detailed 12-month timeline outlining what could happen to the American people if the current tariff-driven trajectory continues without intervention:\n\nJune–July 2025: Recession Declared, Public Pressure Builds\n\t•\tRecession officially confirmed as GDP shrinks in Q2 2025.\n\t•\tUnemployment rises to 6.2%; layoffs concentrated in logistics, manufacturing, and retail.\n\t•\tPort of LA traffic down 35–40%; national import flow craters.\n\t•\tConsumer Confidence Index drops below 80.\n\t•\tProtests begin in port cities (e.g., LA, Seattle) over job losses and inflation.\n\t•\tSocial media disinformation spikes, fueling confusion and outrage.\n\t•\tEarly signs of coordinated labor strikes in supply chain sectors.\n\n⸻\n\nAugust–September 2025: Economic Inequality Ignites Frustration\n\t•\tBack-to-school inflation hits 12–15%; families can’t afford supplies.\n\t•\tSmall business bankruptcies up 30% YoY; Black and immigrant-owned businesses hit hardest.\n\t•\tRent delinquencies rise 25%, especially in urban areas.\n\t•\tLocal governments face budget gaps from reduced tax revenue.\n\t•\tStreet protests expand, including union walkouts and flash strikes.\n\t•\tIsolated clashes with law enforcement reported in at least 3–5 major cities.\n\t•\tMilitia rhetoric and anti-government organizing increase online.\n\n⸻\n\nOctober–November 2025: Civil Unrest Threatens Stability\n\t•\tHoliday inflation hits 10–14%; shelves partially empty.\n\t•\tUnemployment nears 7%, youth unemployment >10%.\n\t•\tMass protests erupt in response to perceived government inaction; occupy-style encampments reappear.\n\t•\tSeveral cities impose curfews or call in National Guard due to escalating unrest.\n\t•\tDisruptions to public transportation and commerce in urban centers (e.g., Chicago, NYC, Atlanta).\n\t•\tSocial fabric frays: increase in thefts, flash mobs, and property damage.\n\n⸻\n\nDecember 2025–January 2026: Widespread Social Strain\n\t•\tWinter heating + food costs overwhelm low-income families.\n\t•\tFood insecurity hits 1 in 5 households; federal relief delayed.\n\t•\tRural and working-class frustration grows, with localized protests against both state and federal governments.\n\t•\tCyberattacks or hacking threats to state infrastructure increase amid anti-government activism.\n\t•\tPolice morale and staffing shortages worsen in high-conflict zones.\n\n⸻\n\nFebruary–March 2026: Fragmentation & Institutional Erosion\n\t•\tSustained unrest becomes normalized in certain cities; protest fatigue met with radicalization in fringes.\n\t•\tVoter trust in all branches of government drops below 25%, lowest in modern history.\n\t•\tRecession continues, but recovery delayed by unrest, instability, and low global confidence.\n\t•\tMilitia groups, separatist rhetoric, and conspiracy movements gain traction, pushing disinformation.\n\t•\tCalls grow for a national unity response, but partisan deadlock remains.\n\n⸻\n\nThis is a highly pessimistic scenario, but it’s modeled on how prolonged economic distress and leadership vacuums historically create conditions for widespread unrest—seen in the 1930s, 1960s, and at moments during the COVID-19 pandemic."

In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Kreiz was asked whether it would be cheaper to relocate some manufacturing to the U.S. due to the tariffs, but responded: \"We don't see that happening.\" \"We believe that production in other countries—where we can be efficient and more productive—is the best balance between manufacturing outside of the U.S. and [continuing] to develop product in terms of design and creativity in America,\" he said. In response to the price increases, and similar announcements made by car manufacturer Ford this week, Trump said: \"I think they're saying that just to negotiate deals with me.\"\n\n> Trump's remark on Mattel \"trying to go somewhere else,\" and the resulting threat of a targeted, 100 percent tariff on its toys was somewhat ambiguous, given the company has only advocated shifting more of its manufacturing outside of China."

        "selftext": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that Walmart should \"eat the tariffs\" instead of blaming duties imposed by his administration on imported goods for the retailer's increased prices.\n\nHis comments were in response to the world's largest retailer saying this week it would have to start raising prices later this month due to high tariffs.\n\n\"Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected,\" Trump said in a social media post.\n\n\"Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, 'EAT THE TARIFFS,' and not charge valued customers ANYTHING.\"\n\nA representative of Walmart could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nWalmart CEO Doug McMillon said on Thursday the retailer could not absorb all the tariff costs because of narrow retail margins. Even so, he said, the company was committed to ensuring that tariff-related costs on general merchandise - which primarily comes from China - would not drive food prices higher.\n\nMany U.S. companies have either slashed or pulled their full-year expectations in the wake of friction between the U.S. and its trading partners, particularly China, as consumers curtail spending.\n\nAs a bellwether of U.S. consumer health, Walmart's explicit statement about the impact of tariffs is a signpost for how the trade war is affecting the retail sector. Walmart is noted for its ability to manage costs more aggressively than other companies to keep prices low.\n\nEvery week, some 255 million people shop in its stores or place orders online around the world, and 90% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles (16 km) of a Walmart.\n\nWalmart's disclosure comes about three weeks after a published report that Amazon planned to disclose how much Trump-imposed tariffs were adding to the costs of its products. The White House blasted Amazon over the report, which the company promptly denied.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-tells-walmart-eat-tariffs-144516437.html"

They include major grocers and consumer goods sellers Costco, Best Buy, Walmart and Target. President Donald Trump’s ever-changing trade policy has roiled retailers as they try to plan their supply chains. On earnings calls, they faced the difficult task of trying to appease investors who want them to protect their bottom lines and shoppers who could balk at price hikes.\n\n> In some cases, companies have been explicit, citing the estimated toll tariffs will take on their bottom lines and breaking down which countries their supply chains rely on. Other retailers have been less forthcoming, avoiding the word “tariff” and instead blaming strategy shifts or price hikes on “macroeconomic uncertainty” — or simply refusing to point the finger at all.\n\n> Many retailers have reduced or withdrawn their full-year guidance because of tariffs. Companies such as Abercrombie & Fitch, Macy’s and Best Buy have slashed their profit outlooks. Meanwhile, American Eagle, Canada Goose, Ross and Mattel pulled their full-year guidance.\n\n> Economists on both sides of the aisle agree that tariffs are inflationary and the cost will likely be passed on to consumers, though government data has not showed a clear effect yet.

Even with the Trump administration stating that they’re raising tariff rates on other 12 countries this week, the S&P 500 didn’t even decline a full percentage point. \n\nThe markets current reaction to Trump revamping his tariff talk pales in comparison to the -7% decline after announcing his Canada and Mexico tariffs and the further -12% drop after liberation day. Financial markets have begun to largely ignore Trump and his tariffs, pricing in the expectation that he will ultimately chicken out. \n\nHere’s the thing: Trump always chickens out *because* of the markets reaction. Whether it was his first term tariffs in 2018 or his walk back of the liberation day tariffs or his eventual decision not to fire JPOW, he always chickens out because of the stock or bond market. \n\nWhen the markets stop caring about Trump’s constantly changing tariffs and assume everything will be all right in the end, that’s a **very bad** thing for America. If the market continues to rally based on bullish sentiment while ignoring the possibility that Trump actually keeps the tariffs this time, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. He will move on to destroying something else while the tariffs slowly increase inflation and suppress profits. Then, if earnings start coming in negative and the GDP shrinks, the market could crash again like on April 3rd.\n\nEdit: Not a bear. I own positions in VOO and SCHD."

The U.S. economy added 911,000 fewer jobs over the 12 months ending in March than previously estimated, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said on Tuesday. The figure, which exceeded economists' expectations, appears to be the largest revision ever recorded. The preliminary estimate will be finalized next year. The revision, a routine step in the compilation of government labor statistics, assesses monthly survey estimates alongside state unemployment data. \n\n> The fresh data comes weeks after President Donald Trump fired BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer in response to a weak monthly jobs report. Trump claimed without evidence that McEntarfer had manipulated statistics for political reasons. In a statement on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the unusually large revision cast doubt on the legitimacy of the BLS. Leavitt also appeared to grant credence to the data, citing it as evidence of a weak economy under President Joe Biden. \"Today, the BLS released the largest downward revision on record proving that President Trump was right: Biden’s economy was a disaster and the BLS is broken. This is exactly why we need new leadership to restore trust and confidence in the BLS’s data on behalf of the financial markets, businesses, policymakers, and families that rely on this data to make major decisions,\" Leavitt said."

Trump and his insiders make millions while everyone else gets screwed. \n\nThis H1b policy is so ludicrous, there's no way it can be for real. A sudden $100k annual fee for each h1b employee without any warning is enough to instantly crater many companies and research institutions. Only the tech giants could afford to absorb these costs. It's not just engineers and programmers on h1b, it's researchers, teachers, doctors, nurses, actuaries, mathematicians, etc. using the H1b. \n\nYou're probably going to see tech and biotech stocks drop next Monday, but you may as well make the best of the opportunity and buy some tech stocks in the dip."

Monaco’s having that kind of access is unacceptable, and cannot be allowed to stand,” Trump wrote on social media. “She is a menace to U.S. National Security, especially given the major contracts that Microsoft has with the United States Government.”\n\nFull disclosure: Microsoft is a significant part of my portfolio."
