        "selftext": "Well here it goes. \n\nAbout a year ago I dumped about 5k into a company that I may or may not have had private knowledge of. I thought I was so smart, turns out that less than a month later all my shares are worthless because the company filed for bankruptcy. \n\nFast forward a couple months and my position was eliminated and I have been searching for jobs but been unemployed ever since. That 5k was a big chunk of my savings and with being unemployed and having bills to pay I quickly ran out of cash. I racked up about 12,000 in credit card debt and needed money fast. \n\nSo naturally, I started gambling. I gambled by using this same credit card on some sketchy online casino, I didn’t deposit much at once, usually only $100 or so, but man I realized I had a gambling addiction once I spent over 4k on this site. I was making the money back but then I was chasing my losses and lost it all. \n\nThen autopay resumed on my card and tried to charge my entire balance which I didn’t have and Amex canceled my card. I was still making my monthly payments before that. \n\nSo now I’m 16k in debt on this card, 3k on another, and have about $100 to my name. I sold my computers and guns and anything worth money but now I don’t know how I am going to pay my bills this month. \n\nGuys, please be careful, be honest with yourselves, casino gambling and options gambling are both just as dangerous. You have to limit yourself or else you are a few bad days away from being like me. \n\nI don’t know what I’m gonna do anymore but I thought I’d leave a warning for other degenerate gamblers like me. \n\n"

        "selftext": "> Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek rocked global technology stocks Monday, raising questions over America’s technological dominance.\n\n> Buzz grew over the weekend about DeepSeek’s latest AI model being cost-effective while running on less-advanced chips, casting doubt on the validity of the rich valuations for companies like Nvidia Corp., which has led the global AI stock boom as its chips have been seen as essential to the technology. \n\n> Shares of [Nvidia] slid 10% in premarket trading on Monday. \n\n> Nasdaq 100 futures tumbled 3.4%, while contracts on the S&P 500 fell 2% as of 5 a.m. in New York. \n\n> In Europe, tech stocks led market losses, with shares of chip equipment maker ASML Holding NV down 11%. \n\n> The Cboe Volatility Index, known as the VIX, spiked higher. The Nasdaq 100 and Europe’s Stoxx 600 technology sub-index were together set for a market capitalization wipeout of roughly $1 trillion, if the losses hold.\n\n> Roughly 200,000 Nasdaq 100 futures contracts changed hands by 4:45 a.m. New York time, about four times more than the 30-day average for this time of day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n> AI trades slumped elsewhere as investors rethought assumptions on computing power and energy. Siemens Energy AG, one of the few AI winners in Europe, slid 20%."

It would have applied to Medicare payments for certain drugs administered in doctors’ offices. However, it is unclear what payments or drugs the new directive would apply to.\n\nIn a Truth Social post Sunday evening, Trump said he plans to sign an executive order Monday morning that he argues would drastically lower drug prices.\n\n“I will be signing one of the most consequential Executive Orders in our Country’s history. Prescription Drug and Pharmaceutical prices will be REDUCED, almost immediately, by 30% to 80%,” he wrote. “I will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION’S POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World.”\n\nThe directive comes as the Trump administration is also looking to impose tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, which had been exempted from such levies enacted during the president’s first term. The tariffs could exacerbate shortages of certain drugs, particularly generic medicines, and eventually raise prices.\n\nIf the new executive order is comparable to the 2020 rule, both Medicare and its beneficiaries could see savings. But it could also limit patients’ access to medications, experts said. Much depends on how the policy is structured.\n\nAlthough lowering drug prices was a major talking point of his first administration, Trump has not focused on the topic as much this term. And his campaign told Politico last year that he had moved away from the “Most Favored Nation” model, which many Republicans strongly oppose.\n\nBut the administration revived the idea recently as a potential way to meet deep spending cut targets for Medicaid in the House GOP’s sweeping tax and spending cuts package. However, it’s unclear whether the proposal will be included in the legislation, the details of which should be announced shortly, or whether it would be covered by the executive order.\n\nThe initiative will likely face stiff opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which successfully halted the first iteration.\n\nThe Trump administration introduced the idea of tying Medicare’s drug reimbursements to the prices in other countries in 2018 and finalized the rule just after the 2020 election. The seven-year model would have allowed the US to piggyback on discounts negotiated by other peer countries, which typically pay far less for medications in large part because their governments often determine the cost.\n\nUnder the 2020 initiative, Medicare would have paid the lowest price available among those peer countries for 50 Part B drugs that are administered in doctors’ offices. The administration estimated it would have saved about $86 billion.\n\nAt the time, Medicare was barred from negotiating drug prices, but that changed with the 2022 passage of the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act, which gave Medicare the historic power to bargain over prices for a small number of drugs annually.\n\nA “Most Favored Nation” proposal could save beneficiaries’ money in their out-of-pocket costs and their premiums, which are both affected by the price of drugs, experts said."

The announcement sent copper prices immediately up over 10% before prices retreated some later Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe president didn't specifically outline when the new copper tariff would take effect but he has the power to implement them immediately once an investigation by his administration is concluded.\n\nThe president also teased other major announcements set for the coming weeks on top of this week’s focus on “reciprocal” tariffs, saying “we're going to be announcing pharmaceuticals, chips” in the weeks ahead — a reference to upcoming plans around prescription drugs and semiconductors.\n\nHe didn’t offer a specific timeline on the pharmaceutical tariffs but suggested there could be a extended easing in period.\n\n\"We're going to give people about a year, a year and a half to come in, and after that they're going to be tariffed,\" he said, while also offering an eye-popping number for the final duty by saying it will be “a very, very high rate, like 200%.”\n\n“We'll give them a certain period of time to get their act together,” Trump added.\n\nHis action on copper could be felt more quickly, with the president signaling an end to an ongoing Commerce Department investigation of possible duties under Section 232 tariff authority that began in February.\n\nTrump implemented tariffs on steel and aluminum in March but held off on copper.\n\nIt was yet another aggressive Trump move on trade in a week where he threatened of 25% duties on South Korea and Japan on Monday and then said on Tuesday that a new tariff deadline of Aug. 1 won't be extended.\n\nIt was a return to trade rhetoric from Trump that has been more muted in recent weeks but was on full display during the cabinet meeting and has marked Trump's political career as part of what he says is his quest to protect America.\n\n\"People that sat in this room allowed it to happen,\" he said of previous trade policies while talking in the White House's Cabinet room, \"and I don't allow it to happen.\""

For the first 6 months, my big winner was HIMS, although I sold WAY too early. I bought calls around $10 and sold around $20-$24. My other big plays have been scalping NVDA and especially GOOGL. Despite being a lousy hold for the last year, I've consistently YOLO'd into GOOGL on big pull backs, including the Apple congressional testimony news (Google searches were down for the first time on Safari, although Google denied this.)\n\nMy strategy is to buy near or at-the-money calls 2-5 months out with at least one earnings in between. I don't usually hold through earnings. I try to scale out of the position over the course of 2-10 trading days. I'm happy with 20%-50% gains and am fine with leaving money on the table. Because the calls are many months out, there isn't too much theta decay if the stock goes sideways.\n\nI generally keep cash on the side to YOLO into calls if there's a huge overreaction on a given ticker. If I'm fully invested, it's hard to take advantage of certain opportunities. I don't think I have that much patience, but I've definitely improved since my early trading days.\n\nOn Friday I sold most of the portfolio and am now 85%  in cash. The other 15% is in QQQ puts and UNH calls. I think there will be buying opportunities soon given the new EU / Canada tariff news, but ultimately, as we all know, taco's gonna taco."

I had to deposit another $10,000 to pick myself up and take revenge on the market. \n\nLuckily I caught Google on the dip to 148 and I had conviction that Google was going to the moon based on its P/E and great ai plays. \n\nI kept buying 5% otm calls 30 days out on red days and selling when the calls were in the money. Then I would open another position with more and more contracts every time. \n\nThe last push was this weekend before Labor Day I held $450,000 cash and unloaded it on the dip Monday at 207 and bought $4.70 950 contracts of 220 strike calls for 10/17. Those calls were up $91,000 end of the day as you can see from my previous post. Today I sold at $16 per contract. "
