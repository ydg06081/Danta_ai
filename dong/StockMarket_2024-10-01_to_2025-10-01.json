The White House has said those tariffs are set to take effect April 2.\n\nHe then singled out Canada, criticizing the top trading partner at length and declaring, “We don’t need anything they have,” while repeating his calls to turn the U.S. northern neighbor into the “51st state.”\n\nTrump added, “There’ll be a little disruption, but it won’t be very long.”\n\nTrump’s comments came as major stock indexes continued to tumble Thursday, with the S&P 500 falling 10% from its recent highs and entering correction territory.\n\nNumerous analysts and business leaders have warned that Trump’s tariffs, and his unpredictable use of them, are sowing chaos in the markets.\n\nBut Trump has continued to issue new tariff threats this week, as he seeks to hit back at countries that have retaliated against his actions.\n\nAfter new U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports took effect Wednesday, the European Union responded by announcing a plan to impose a 50% tariff on imports of American whiskey and other U.S. goods.\n\nTrump lashed out Thursday morning, declaring that he would slap 200% tariffs on EU alcohol exports — including all wines and French champagnes — unless the bloc dropped its countermeasure.\n\nEarlier in the week, Trump threatened to double his tariffs on steel and aluminum from Canada, starting Wednesday, in response to Ontario’s retaliatory decision to slap a 25% tax on electricity exports to the U.S.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford paused his countermeasure hours later, and Trump backed off his threat."

But he has been bewildered by Musk’s chainsaw-waving leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency, which he called “chaotic.” Controversy surrounding Musk is bad for Tesla sales, he said.\n\n“I think the brand is irreparably damaged at this point,” Hanna said.\n\nJust a few months ago, investors were betting that a second Trump administration would be great news for Tesla. Instead, the longtime stock-market highflier has plummeted in 2025. Shares have fallen more than 40% this year, erasing about $536 billion in market value. The stock is on track for a nine-week streak of losses—its longest on record. \n\nPart of that decline stems from investors’ broad retreat from the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks that drove markets higher last year. Worries about economic growth and Trump’s trade fights have driven declines in some of the market’s biggest gainers. Tesla’s business has also faced unique challenges. Competition has increased while sales have faltered; on Thursday, the company recalled most Cybertrucks because an exterior panel might fall off and endanger motorists. \n\nBut Musk’s role in the administration has repelled some of the fans who helped popularize Tesla cars and make the stock one of Wall Street’s hottest trades. For some, mass firings of federal workers are the issue, while others are concerned with his social-media posts or just think he is too distracted with government business to run Tesla. Protesters have demonstrated at Tesla showrooms and some cars and charger stations have been vandalized. \n\nThe topic has entered the political arena, with Trump administration officials talking up Tesla. Trump earlier this month selected a red Tesla sedan at the White House in a show of support. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick used a TV appearance this week to recommend the public buy shares, saying: “It’s unbelievable that this guy’s stock is this cheap. It’ll never be this cheap again.” \n\nIndividual investors have long flocked to the shares, betting that Musk’s leadership could make Tesla worth far more than an ordinary car company. It was the kind of loyalty that inspired at least one to get the company’s logo tattooed on his arm. \n\nPlenty of individual investors are still piling in. Of the $8.3 billion that individual investors poured into single stocks last week, roughly $3.2 billion flowed into Tesla, according to a Wednesday report from JPMorgan analysts.  \n\nBut investors’ devotion is being tested. Some sellers say they are driven by disapproval of Musk’s government cuts, or moral opposition to his more controversial social-media posts. \n\nEdward Sanchez, based in San Jose, Calif., was both a Tesla car owner and shareholder until just a week ago, when he sold the stock. Now, he’s considering getting rid of the car, too.\n\nHe purchased the vehicle in 2016 and then about 150 shares in the company five or six years ago, having bought into Musk’s techno-utopian vision for electric vehicles. That resonated with Sanchez, a tech worker who likes to support environmentalist causes. \n\n“It was a very innovative car. There was nothing at all like it back then,” he said of his 2016 Model S. “It was cool to be associated with the brand and with such a smart person.”\n\nAs Musk became more involved in conservative politics, Sanchez’s skepticism grew. He was appalled when the CEO made a gesture at an inauguration event in January that some interpreted to be a Nazi salute. The recent display of various Tesla models in front of the White House was another cringeworthy moment, he said.\n\nSanchez finally liquidated all his shares in March, he said, though his financial adviser suggested he hold on and wait for the stock price to recover some of its losses. “I told him, ‘I don’t care, I want out.’”\n\nFor others, the concern is more practical. Tony Herbert first spotted a Tesla at a birthday party in 2012 in Dallas and immediately wanted one for himself. In 2018, he invested around $5,000 in the company—the first stock he ever bought—with the goal of using profits from the rising share price to purchase a Model 3.\n\nIn the years that followed, his investment ballooned. But in February, he sold it all. He felt that billionaires were being villainized by the public, and he was starting to lose faith that the stock could stay on track. Herbert said he would consider jumping back in at a lower price. First, he would like to see one change in the company: a new executive. \n\n“Elon’s too focused on other things,” he said."

        "selftext": "Just days out from Trump’s April 2 announcement of global tariffs, which he has hailed as “Liberation Day,” even those closest to the president — from Vice President JD Vance to his chief of staff Susie Wiles and his own Cabinet officials — have privately indicated that they’re unsure exactly what the boss will do, according to three people who have spoken with them.\n\nWhile some details of the administration’s plan for what Trump has dubbed “reciprocal tariffs” on global trading partners are starting to trickle out, the president has at times upended them or floated contradictory policies that are keeping everyone — even his inner circle — guessing.\n\n“No one knows what the f*** is going on,” said one White House ally close to Trump’s inner circle, granted anonymity to speak freely. “What are they going to tariff? Who are they gonna tariff and at what rates? Like, the very basic questions haven’t been answered yet.”\n\nIndeed, while the White House is projecting confidence publicly, multiple administration officials, as well as top allies on the outside, are privately concerned that next week’s roll-out could be as rocky as when he imposed tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China on March 4, worsening a rout on stocks that began in mid-February. Though the S&P 500 has since regained some ground, all of its previous gains since Election Day have been erased.\n\nCase in point: Wednesday’s decision to slap the auto industry with 25 percent tariffs. While expected in some fashion in the near future, the announcement came together so last minute that the White House wasn’t fully prepared and had to delay afternoon programming as they sought to finalize the plan, according to two people familiar with the roll-out.\n\nThe White House also didn’t brief industry stakeholders in the U.S. or abroad beforehand — though a White House official argued that if they were “smart” they would have known it was coming, since Trump himself issued a public warning.\n\n“I think it would be a mistake to think next week all of a sudden we’re going to get a bunch of clarity,” said Tom Graff, chief investment officer at financial advisory firm Facet. “I’m sure they’re trying to reset with financial markets and build some certainty, but I don’t think the president is going to have a personality transplant.”\n\n“I think he wants to keep his options open,” Graff added.\n\nIn a series of statements, the White House and the various Cabinet heads said the administration is working together to implement Trump’s vision. “As the movie ‘Drumline’ goes, ‘one band, one sound,’” White House senior adviser for trade and manufacturing Peter Navarro said in a statement.\n\n“We are the greatest economic team and April 2nd will be a historic day for American workers,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said.\n\n“We may have sectoral tariffs on April 2, and we may not,” a White House official, granted anonymity to discuss ongoing deliberations, said Monday. “No final decisions have been made yet on sectoral tariffs being tacked onto” the reciprocal tariff announcement next week.\n\nNeedless to say, the president’s shifting desires have made it difficult to plan, as Cabinet officials have indicated in private. In recent days, Lutnick told U.S. trading partners seeking clarity that he would try to give them a heads up the day before April 2, telling them that the details are too fluid at the moment to preview. Bessent has also admitted to people that the final tariff regime remains a moving target, according to a person who has spoken to him.\n\nThe divisions have caused tensions. While Navarro is a genuine tariff believer, Lutnick — who has a close relationship with Trump and enjoys influence that others in the Cabinet do not, as of yet — is widely seen as supporting whatever Trump wants to ingratiate himself with the president, a dynamic that has infuriated others in the administration.\n\n“He goes into the Oval and tells the president whatever he wants to hear,” said the first White House ally, who called Lutnick a “f***ing nightmare” and argued he does so without consideration of the economic consequences.\n\nOver the past few weeks, the more tariff-cautious faction in the administration has tried gently to pull Trump back from blanket, indiscriminate tariffs.\n\n“I don’t think it’s like no one wants to tell Trump the bad, the hard news,” said one of the outside allies mentioned above. “I think people have tried to have a conversation with him, and he’s dead set on it. He’s a true believer.”\n"

U.S. goods exports to Japan in 2024 were $79.7 billion, up 5.4 percent ($4.1 billion) from 2023. U.S. goods imports from Japan totaled $148.2 billion in 2024, up 0.7 percent ($971 million) from 2023. The U.S. goods trade deficit with Japan was $68.5 billion in 2024, a 4.3 percent decrease ($3.1 billion) over 2023”\n\nThe math goes like this: (1 – (exports/imports)). After applying for Japan, your formula becomes (1 minus (79.7/148.2)). The result of that value is 0.4622, which comes out to the tariff value that Trump uses. It’s bad economics, and there’s no way to sugarcoat it: it’s stupid.\n\nBut, you know what, let’s do Taiwan as well. From the USTR site:\n\nU.S. total goods trade with Taiwan were an estimated $158.6 billion in 2024. U.S. goods exports to Taiwan in 2024 totaled $42.3 billion, up 6.0 percent ($2.4 billion) from 2023.  U.S. goods imports from Taiwan in 2024 totaled $116.3 billion, up 32.5 percent ($28.5 billion) from 2023.  The U.S. goods trade deficit with Taiwan was $73.9 billion in 2024, a 54.6 percent increase ($26.1 billion) over 2023.\n\nThe formula becomes: (1 minus (42.3 / 116.3)).

For example, if China were really imposing a 67% tariff on U.S. goods or if Vietnam were implementing a 90% tariff on U.S. products, that’s something that likely would have been retaliated against a long time ago. But in fact, these numbers do not represent “tariffs.”\n\n>\n\n>Take the E.U. “tariff” on U.S. goods of 39%. In 2024, the U.S. exported $370.2 billion to the E.U., according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Meanwhile, the U.S. imported $605.8 billion from the E.U. That means the U.S. ran a trade deficit with the E.U. of $235.6 billion.\n\n>\n\n>**What the Trump administration seems to have done is taken the deficit ($235.6 billion) and divided it by the total number of imports from the E.U. ($605.8 billion), yielding a figure of 38.89%, which the administration rounded up to 39% and called a “Tariff to the U.S.A.” imposed by the E.U. But obviously, that is not a tariff.**\n\nSo to make this clear, since we buy 97% more from Cambodia than they buy from us, he said they have a 97% tariff on us and imposed a 49% tariff in retaliation.\n\nAnd that number *is not only the wrong THING* it's also the wrong *number* because Trump *only counted goods* and 1/3 of US exports are *services.*\n\nSo so so so so so so so stupid!\n\nNow consider that *the Council of Economic Advisers* knows perfectly well the difference between the balance of trade and a tariff, but they can't tell him because he's such a raging narcissist that no one can ever disagree with him and you have to do what he says or he'll make you his next enemy.\n\nSo they printed up that table for him to carry to his speech, knowing that 100% of what is printed on it is absolute nonsense.\n\nAnd because he's a narcissist he wants to be your dictator, to invade Panama, Greenland and Canada. And because he has malignant narcissism as a severe personality disorder and is deeply mentally ill, he wants to do this while basking in the radiance of Vladimir Putin *who he worships and who he emotionally confuses with himself!*\n\nFor instance (it took a long time to find a transcript that left in the scary insanity and didn't sane wash Trump):\n\n>“She is asking what if Russia breaks the ceasefire.”\n\n>\n\n>Trump: “What, if anything? What if the bomb drops on your head right now? OK, what if they broke it? I don’t know, they broke it with Biden because Biden, they didn’t respect him. They didn’t respect Obama. They respect me. Let me tell you, *Putin went through a hell of a lot with me. He went through a phony witch hunt where they used him and Russia, Russia, Russia! You ever hear of that deal? That was a phony Hunter Biden, Joe Biden scam. ... And he had to go through that Hillary Clinton, shifty Adam Schiff. It was a Democrat scam. And he had to go through that. And he did go through it. We didn’t end up in a war. And he went through it. He was accused of all that stuff. He had nothing to do with it. It came out of Hunter Biden’s bathroom. It came out of Hunter Biden’s bedroom. It was disgusting. And then they said, ‘Oh, the laptop from hell was made by Russia.’ The 51 agents. The whole thing was a scam. And he had to put up with that. He was being accused of all that stuff. All I can say is this: … All I can say is this. He might have broken deals with Obama and Bush, and he might have broken them with Biden. He did, maybe. Maybe he did. I don’t know what happened, but he didn’t break them with me. He wants to make a deal. I don’t know if you can make a deal.”*\n\nI'd like to add that if Trump *IS* doing this on purpose, then the idea is to *threaten* all of the billionaires and corporations so that they come crawling to him and *he can force them to support his dictatorship in return for not immediately putting them out of business.* I think he *stumbled onto a strategy of deliberately hurting the country* by accident. He's a confused old man, but he'll do anything for a big enough bribe. So this works for him.\n\nCongress, not the President is supposed to be in charge of tariffs. Trump is using some bullshit emergency war power. Congress can and should put an end to this charade.\n\nHe has the power to veto congress, but *I think he's going to crash the economy and stock market so deeply into depression that an override will be easy to get!* I feel weird making any predictions, but Trump is *so disconnected from reality that the situation is that bad.*"

        "selftext": "Are these 2 indicators of a bearish market to come? Is China dumping US bonds? The dollar has fallen 9% in 3 months. What is causing this?\n\nAnalysts from AI:\n\nIt’s actually an unusual combination—spiking 10-year U.S. Treasury yields usually coincide with a stronger U.S. dollar, not a weaker one. So if both are happening at once (higher yields and a 9% drop in the dollar over three months), it suggests some complex or global dynamics are in play. Let’s unpack the potential causes:\n\n⸻\n\n1. Inflation Expectations & Domestic Factors\n\t•\tHigh Inflation: If investors expect inflation to stay elevated or worsen, they’ll demand higher yields to compensate for loss of purchasing power.\n\t•\tStubborn Core Inflation: Even if headline inflation comes down, sticky core inflation could push yields up while hurting confidence in the dollar.\n\t•\tFiscal Deficits: Concerns about ballooning U.S. deficits (especially due to stimulus, military spending, or entitlement costs) can push up yields and hurt dollar sentiment.\n\n⸻\n\n2. Fed Policy Divergence\n\t•\tFed’s Dovish Pivot: If the Fed hints at rate cuts or pauses sooner than expected—while inflation remains high—bond yields might rise on long-term inflation fears, while the dollar drops because of lower short-term interest rate expectations.\n\t•\tLoss of Credibility: If markets start doubting the Fed’s ability or willingness to control inflation, that undermines the dollar and drives long-term yields higher.\n\n⸻\n\n3. Global Risk Sentiment & Capital Flows\n\t•\tForeign Selling of Treasuries: If major holders like China or Japan start reducing their Treasury holdings, it drives yields up. At the same time, selling USD to repatriate funds weakens the dollar.\n\t•\tGeopolitical Events: War, trade disruptions, or global realignments could cause capital to flow away from U.S. assets, leading to both a weaker dollar and higher yields.\n\t•\tRisk-Off to Risk-On Shift Globally: If global markets become more risk-tolerant, investors may shift out of U.S. assets into emerging markets, weakening the dollar and pushing up yields as demand for Treasuries wanes.\n\n⸻\n\n4. Supply-Demand Imbalances\n\t•\tLarge Treasury Issuance: If the U.S. Treasury floods the market with new debt (to finance deficits or economic packages), it increases supply and pushes yields up. If demand doesn’t keep pace, and especially if foreign buyers pull back, the dollar can weaken too.\n\n⸻\n\n5. Speculation or Technical Dynamics\n\t•\tShort-Dollar Positioning: Hedge funds or institutions betting against the dollar can accelerate its fall, especially if fundamentals support that view.\n\t•\tCurve Steepening Trades: Investors might expect long-term inflation but short-term economic weakness, causing a steepening yield curve and boosting 10-year yields even as the dollar drops.\n\n⸻\n\nExample Scenario:\n\nImagine this setup:\n\t•\tInflation has cooled slightly, but not enough.\n\t•\tThe Fed signals it will pause or cut rates soon.\n\t•\tMeanwhile, the U.S. announces a large spending package and massive bond issuance.\n\t•\tForeign buyers hesitate, selling Treasuries.\n\t•\tGlobal investors anticipate long-term inflation and avoid the dollar.\n\nIn that world, you’d get higher 10-year yields and a weaker dollar simultaneously.\n\n⸻\n\nWould you like to dive into how gold or equities typically respond in a scenario like this too?"

And China knows exactly how vital this is to U.S. tech dominance.\n\nAll major tech players from NVIDIA to Apple rely on these resources.

That’s not just volatility it’s a red flag. For those unfamiliar: bond yields go up when demand drops. And the 10-year is the backbone of global risk pricing.\n\nHistorically, when stocks drop, bonds rally they’re the safe haven. But not now. Stocks are falling. Bonds are falling. That’s not “normal” even Barclays titled their client note: “This is not normal.”\n\nWhy it matters?\n\n    1. China is signaling it’s done playing nice. Selling Treasuries isn’t just diversification it’s a geopolitical move.\n 2. If Europe joins the sell-off (and some signs suggest they might), this becomes more than a warning it’s a structural unraveling of confidence in U.S. fiscal stability.\n3. Every long red candle you see? That’s not panic over tariffs or Tesla’s margins that’s institutional capital quietly stepping off the table.\n\nSure, the market bounced on Friday. But don’t let that fool you these rebounds are like spasms in a body under shock. The fundamental shift is already underway. No tweet will stop it. Not even one from the king of tariffs himself.\n\nThe U.S. can’t keep applying band-aids with election-year PR while the world begins to hedge against the dollar and U.S. debt. So if you’re wondering why “good news” isn’t saving the market anymore it’s because the people who move this market have already left the room.\n\nUpdate: Yes the sell-off isn’t typical. We saw a similar move back in 2018, when Russia sharply reduced its U.S. Treasury holdings it was visible in the TIC reports with a sudden $80B drop. They used custodial accounts in Belgium, masking direct attribution at first.\n\nNow we see similar behavior: yields are rising fast without major domestic triggers, and China just halted rare earth exports a clear geopolitical signal. Add to that the drop in FX reserves and quiet USD accumulation by the PBoC this points to China likely selling Treasuries.\n\nThis isn’t just technical foreign exit is real, and it’s strategic."

        "selftext": "**TL;DR** \\- Trump is using exorbitant tariffs to bankrupt as much of the American economy as possible so that his billionaire buddies can scoop it all up at fire sale prices using 1%-2% interest rate loans.  \n  \nThese headlines point to a very real problem brewing with the astronomical tariffs on China. The 145%-245% tariffs on Chinese goods are driving most businesses in the U.S. to cancel orders from China and existing Chinese freight inbound to the U.S. is at severe risk of being abandoned. Instead of causing hyperinflation, U.S. importers are smart enough to realize the American consumer won't pay $35 for one bath towel that used to cost $9.99 so they're just pulling the plug on importing China goods altogether.  \n  \nLet's look at what this means from the retail sector's perspective. It's no secret most goods sold in U.S. retail stores are Made in China. If there is a complete stoppage of trade between the U.S. and China because of these tariffs, then in just a few months there will be nothing left to buy. If the store shelves are mostly empty at U.S. retailers, then retailers have no products to sell. There is currently no alternative place to purchase the goods we import from China. Domestic production is years away. No products to sell means zero revenue. Zero revenue means certain bankruptcy.  \n  \nBankruptcy means mass layoffs. Mass layoffs in retail cascades into other industries as people no longer have a source of income. Companies in other sectors not relying on Chinese imports will have problems staying afloat. Also mortgage defaults will rise leading to more foreclosures on homes.  \n  \nSo who benefits from this? Obviously Trump and his billionaire friends do. Causing a mass shortage of goods from China is going to bankrupt a lot of companies. Companies that then can be bought up for pennies on the dollar by the billionaires. And how are they going to fund these acquisitions?  \n  \nSimple. Fire Jerome Powell, lower interest rates to zero percent, then buy up everything using 1%-2% interest rate loans against their assets. Why do you think Trump put a 90-day pause in for his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs? To give his billionaire friends exit liquidity so they can preserve capital that then can be borrowed against once sh\\*t really hits the fan.  \n  \nThe Liberation Day tariffs were never about bringing manufacturing back to the U.S., and sky-high tariffs against China is literally bringing all trade with China to a halt. Again who benefits? Not you or I. We just won't have anything to purchase at the stores anymore for God knows how long. It's the billionaires who benefit the most from this, not anyone else.  \n  \nOf course Trump is the perfect person to do all of this. Because nobody knows more about bankrupting businesses than him.  And if this actually isn't his plan, then he has the most highly regarded economic policy in the history of mankind."

The benchmark S&P 500 Index was down 2% on the day.\n\nThe Fed's wait-and-see approach on interest rates has angered Trump. On Friday a Trump adviser said the administration is studying options for firing Powell, fueling concerns about the central bank's autonomy and rattling investors grappling with an intensifying trade war."

We’re not talking about a bad situation anymore, we’re talking about something outright dangerous.\n\nThe independence of the Federal Reserve is a fundamental pillar for maintaining inflation expectations (2% target) and labor market stability. Without it, markets lose trust, rates could spike uncontrollably, and the dollar’s status as a reserve currency might start to crumble.\n\nWhat’s even more alarming is how little Trump seems to understand — not only about trade, where his ideas are already widely discredited, but even about basic economic expectations. He cites energy prices as a sign of lower inflation, completely ignoring the medium- and long-term expectations, which are clearly pointing toward a reemergence of inflationary pressure.\n\nThe idea that the Fed should be punished or politicized based on short-term price fluctuations is not just wrong — it’s borderline suicidal for an advanced economy. You can’t run a country like a casino. And this time, if he pushes through with this, the entire global financial system will take notice."

Maybe it's a negotiating tactic. But the lack of publicly announced deal progress is depressing the dollar, spiking bond yields and leading to a flight to quality to gold and now Bitcoin.\n\nFormer US Assistant Secretary of Defense and veteran diplomat Chas Freeman also relayed a similar story on YouTube:\n\n>The Japanese have just been in Washington. Their experience apparently was they went to talk to the American leadership on this matter, and the American leadership said 'what are you offering?' And the Japanese said 'well, what is it that you want?' And the Americans could not explain what they wanted.'\n\nThe Art of the Deal, evidently. If I'm one of those countries, I would make a whole bunch of promises that sound good in a headline, like buying fighter planes and whatnot ... then just not do those things. You're probably only going to have to leg it out until the mid-terms."

        "selftext": "WASHINGTON/DETROIT (Reuters) -A group representing General Motors, Ford and Stellantis blasted President Donald Trump's trade deal announced with the United Kingdom, saying it would harm the U.S. auto sector.\n\nBritish carmakers will be given a quota of 100,000 cars a year that can be sent to the United States at a 10% tariff rate, almost the total Britain exported last year, compared to 25% for Mexico and Canada and nearly all other countries.\n\n\"Under this deal, it will now be cheaper to import a UK vehicle with very little U.S. content than a USMCA compliant vehicle from Mexico or Canada that is half American parts,\" said the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents the Detroit Three automakers. \"This hurts American automakers, suppliers, and auto workers.\"\n\nU.S. automakers are concerned this could be a template for other agreements that could put vehicles they assemble in Canada or Mexico at a disadvantage. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe group added it hopes \"this preferential access for UK vehicles over North American ones does not set a precedent for future negotiations with Asian and European competitors.\"\n\nTrump last month softened the blow of his auto tariffs by easing the impact of tariffs on parts and materials but left in place 25% tariffs on imported vehicles. He also extended a duty-free exemption for North American parts that comply with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement (USMCA) rules of origin.\n\nAutomakers have hoped that Trump would ease vehicle tariffs.\n\nFord this week confirmed it hiked prices of some Mexican-built vehicles because of tariffs and said Trump's trade war would add about $2.5 billion in costs for 2025, but expects to reduce that exposure by around $1 billion.\n\nRival GM said tariffs were projected to cost it between $4 billion and $5 billion, but it expected to offset that by at least 30%, while Toyota projected tariff costs for April and May at around $1.2 billion.\n\nSource:\n\n* No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/detroit-three-automakers-blast-trump-202154913.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/detroit-three-automakers-blast-trump-202154913.html)\n* Paywall: [https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/detroit-three-automakers-blast-trump-uk-trade-deal-2025-05-08/](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/detroit-three-automakers-blast-trump-uk-trade-deal-2025-05-08/)"

I’m not denying economic tension, especially for US. But the disinformation is throwing me off. Why is it necessary?\n\nCan anyone share real, ground-level info?

This will eventually impact corporate strategy, as there would be no clarity."

GOP leaders worked overnight and the president himself leaned on a handful of skeptics to drop their opposition and send the bill to his desk to become law.\n\nThe outcome delivers a milestone for the president and his party, a longshot effort to compile a lengthy list of GOP priorities into what they called his “one big beautiful bill,” an 800-plus page package. With Democrats unified in opposition, the bill will become a defining measure of Trump’s return to the White House, with the sweep of Republican control of Congress."

But he added that he believes Trump heard Democrats’ objections “for the first time,” suggesting the face-to-face was at least partially constructive.\n\nBoth sides continued to assert that the other would be to blame if the government does shut down starting Wednesday.\n\n“It’s up to the Republicans whether they want to shut down or not,” Schumer said.\n\n**This is breaking news. Please refresh for updates.**\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n  \nI wonder if the new ballroom will still get worked on ????"
